0,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already. I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.

It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.

I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.

I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!

The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.

Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.

Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.

With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.

Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.

This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.

***UPDATE***
Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.

This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.

***ANOTHER UPDATE***
From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.

***ONE MORE UPDATE***
Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.

I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.

***LAST UPDATE***
Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.",5,0.9642,Positive,971
1,"Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.
Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.
Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.
Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.
A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.
Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.
***UPDATE***
Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.
Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.
Observations.
Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.
I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.
I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.
Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.
I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.
Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.",5,0.9817,Positive,844
2,"Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",5,0.4404,Positive,35
3,"Camera performs as expected and works fine. I took away stars since this camera does not integrate with the ring alarm system. Currently there is NO WAY to get motion alerts or record motion ONLY when no one is home. You can schedule times but schedules change often. I don't need an alert and recording every. single. time. I enter a room...

Idea that tons of people on the web are asking for: Have an option to record motion only if the ring alarm system is set to away mode! If this were available I would easily give 5 stars. If I had known about this issue I would not have bought the ring alarm system or the ring cam. I assumed a top tier company deeply invested in home automation would be on top of this.

Update Jan 2020: The Ring team has updated the Ring app so the camera integrates better with the Ring alarm system. You can now choose when you want the camera to record video. For example, the camera can now be set up to record video and send motion alerts only when the Ring alarm system is set to Away mode which is what I prefer.",4,-0.7262,Negative,202
4,"The picture quality is great and the range seems to work well (mine are 50’ from my router). My complaint is regarding battery life. The product description says 3-6 months battery life. Mine lasted 1 week. The solution was buying solar panels to mount beside the camera.

Purchased a 2 pk of solar panels for $66 from Wasserstein. Ring wants $49 each and only had white available when I went online to purchase. Overall I’m pleased with the cameras but the battery life is a scam. Order your solar panel with the cameras.",3,-0.2382,Negative,93
5,"I rarely write reviews. I was really excited about this product so I ordered two. Just got them today and spent 3 calls with support and they don’t work as intended. I had a breaking on my property two weeks ago. Support tried to help with both and unfortunately hours later nothing. The issue for me is that the notifications barely work. It’s a hit and miss if they do. What’s the point if your devices do not get dependable motion notifications? Customer service was nice but unable to help at this point. I had been burglarized two weeks ago and was expecting that this would be great.

This is my second review. I have to wait for an appointment next week after an email I received today. I didn’t go into full length yesterday because I was upset. First they told me my first device was defective and to open the second one and that I would get a replacement for the first after a hold of 1 dollar on my card. I wanted to test it looking out my living room window. I’ve had no alerts since at all. My neighbors kids came by and knocked on my door and nothing. If you want to watch a live camera all day and night this is for you. We come and go and I pay ADT to monitor my house. I’m angry because I lost a lot of tools and if this doesn’t do motion alerts whether home or not just find something else.",1,-0.5976,Negative,255
6,"Updated review after 24 hours post-installation:
I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with Ring’s new release. I pre-ordered this camera primarily due to the price and I now see why this model is $70 cheaper than the Gen 2 at regular price.

To start, mounting hardware is no longer included. Amazon is now selling a separate kit for mounting (security screws and screwdriver) for $20. To be fair, I feel like if someone is installing these cameras in their home, it’s a good saving to pass on to them.

However, my biggest issue is the build of the Gen 3. Once you plug it in and run through the setup, you can tell that it is inferior to the Gen 2. The field of view in this new camera is a lot smaller as follows:

Gen 3 Stick Up Cam (this model) field of view
110° horizontal, 57° vertical

Versus

Gen 2 Stick Up Cam Wired field of view
150° horizontal, 85° vertical

Therefore, you have less coverage (e.g. if you are trying to see a big back yard) and require multiple cameras. The Gen 2 covered my entire back yard with its near fisheye view. I would require two of these cameras to provide equal coverage.

Motion zones is no longer editable like it was in the previous model. The motion zones is similar to that of the first Gen Ring Doorbell. It is a semi-circle from the bottom of the screen and you can only make the circle bigger (extending motion zone) or smaller (shrinking motion zone). The top half of the screen is completely exposed and cannot be used to detect motion. The Gen 2 allowed me to have different motion zones and allowed me to customized the zones to cover anywhere on the screen I saw fit. This is important as I do not want my patio to be within the motion detection zone since we are relaxing out there quite often.

My issue with the lack of POE as stated in my quick review below stands.

Lastly, the quality of the image, while it is claimed to be 1080p appears to be less of that my Gen 2 with POE. It’s possible that the WiFi signal can be blamed (there is a noticeable lag during live view that I contribute to the WiFi), but the location of my camera is directly beneath my router (~3-5 feet away) therefore cannot be blamed for everything. I have up to 400 mb/s down and 25 mb/s up consistently.

I wish these specs were easily available when the pre-order page was still present. I probably would’ve ordered more Gen 2 than these new Gen 3 had I known. Cost cutting is great and always welcomed, but it should NEVER be at the expense of quality on a once excellent product. Naming this camera as part of the Stick Up line is extremely deceiving since it is so different. I would’ve rather they kept the build and cost the same as Gen 2 since they also released the budget Indoor cam as well.

Original quick review post-unboxing:
I pre-ordered this stick up cam PLUG-IN without the solar power option and received it today. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon/Ring removes the POE input and replaced it with some type of DC plug. I am extremely disappointed and wish I had purchased some more of the second Gen cameras!! Do not buy if you want to use POE.",1,0.9669,Positive,579
7,So the camera is okay if used outdoors. Read others reviews for why exactly indoor use is not great. The biggest disappointment when used outdoors is you cannot set specific motion notification zones like you can with the flood light cam or the other outdoor ring camera. All you can do is slide a sensitivity bar over a general area within the cameras field of view. Does it work...sure...but without zone control its not that great.,3,-0.7571,Negative,76
8,"I work with cameras, WiFi, mesh gear, microwave technology, 4G, etc. I stream audio and video and work with complex systems. Every time I read a Ring forum person write in about a Ring issue, Ring never accepts blame. My Ring doorbell signal is less than my stick up cam and it works great. I am on my second stick up cam, and it has serious flaws. Let’s just say, I can push WiFi down my street, but a stick up cam in the same room, as my router, doesn’t get a decent signal! Folks, we have here a company that has failed to get the bugs out of their firmware. The doorbell works fine, the indoor cam mounted in the garage works fine, all my other cams works fine, but a simple stick up cam doesn’t. No Ring, there are not too many devices on my network, I turned them off just to see if your excuse was even viable. Bottom line is your firmware needs work, a lot of work, even your motion detection has issues, video playback has issues and it’s only on the stick up cam. How do I knows this? Let’s just say, when you try one cam, and it doesn’t work at all, you call Ring and talk real tech, they say send it back and get another, that tells me it’s an issue with the devices, especially when the second one starts up fine then begins to have issues. I even borrowed another indoor cam, and tried it, it worked fine.

Stop pointing the finger at people who buy this and blame them for its issues. It appears your older generation device stick up cams work better. There is a flaw somewhere in the string of code and every new one going out and getting updates will have these issues. I would have bought several of these, but they don’t work. Thankfully I can fall back on other competitor devices in the mean time till you get it right. Don’t be ashamed to stand up and say you made a mistake, stop saying it’s people’s internet or WiFi strength, maybe your WiFi receiver or antenna in the stick up cams has the issue. I can stream some serious bandwidth at 30fps, and not even lose a frame, but yet a $99 camera can’t even stream 5’ from router with serious upload and download speeds. Like I said before my doorbell works perfect, maybe I should mount a few of them around the house, flush them into a concealment, and disable the button. I bet no one has used multiple door bell and small hidden cams yet. They seem to work great! Why is it I can walk down to my mailbox with a streaming WiFi camera I have, and your stick up cam, and the stick up cam drops out, yet my other camera doesn’t? No it’s not arlo, it’s a simple WiFi based camera. Go figure, I bet you got a deal on some second rate WiFi receivers and board antennas hoping 50% or more worked, just look at the amazon feedback, that should support my argument. That’s all.....

After my review was written, Ring tech support reached out to me. Jason, and I spoke for an hour and he gave me a few options. One of the options was to replace my Stick up Cam with the POE Stick up Cam Elite. I was hesitant because I didn’t want to run a Cat6 cable where I had the stick up cam at. He talked to me and asked me to try it. He sent me the Elite version and I tested it. To my surprise it worked flawlessly, so I did the full install. The Elite version allows for much better motion zone control, and since it’s wired to a switch with a POE injector, the activation response is super fast. Because most of the ring cameras are a bit grainy without ambient light or the assistance of additional lighting, I opted to add a dual 500 lumen motion light on my back patio. Walking anywhere near it not only activates the light for a few minutes, but allows the elite stick up cam to get a clear picture. This not only solves my problem, but serves a purpose with the additional lighting. The Elite stick up cam, is the only POE version they make, but if the Ring flood or spot cane POE, I would go with them.

My sincere appreciation goes out to Jason, from Ring. He is fast to respond to emails and gets involved problem solving. I appreciate his help and his concern. I will continue my use of the Elite versions as they work for my applications. I still will return the original stick up cam as it didn’t work for me.",1,0.9946,Positive,806
9,"UPDATE 11/15/19: I've had the camera for two weeks and overall it has performed fine with respect to recording and in freezing weather. The only issue with it is the battery life, if you are planning on putting this camera outdoors GET THE SOLAR PANEL! I've had it up without one because I wanted to see how long the battery would last after being fully charged and for our normal usage. The settings I have it on are: Motion Detection: ON, Motion Frequency: STANDARD, Motion Verification: OFF. Video Settings: Live View - ON, Tap Camera Preview - OFF, Audio streaming/recording - ON, Infrared Lights for Night vision - ON. I also have it linked to the front doorbell so that when it detects motion it triggers the doorbell to begin recording. The traffic in front of the house is steady but not crazy, normal subdivision. With these settings and at the 15 day mark of being up the battery on this camera is currently reading less than 10%. It's a shame that the battery life is on the ""meh"" side, so you either need to have another battery pack as a back up on stand-by or use the solar panel. I'll be adding a solar panel and will report back how it goes with another update.
------------------

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall, I like the simplicity and ease of the Ring system. This is NOT the high-end camera so all you people expecting that at this price point need to get a reality check! READ THE SPECS before you order it, if it does not meet your situation spend the $ and get the high-end one. I already had doorbells (hardwired and battery) along with the security system prior to getting this outdoor camera. The set up was simple enough, just like their other products, it was easy to link it with the alarm base, and set up the motion detection. One feature it does have is the ability to link it with the other doorbell cameras and cameras that I have. For example, if the front doorbell detects motion I can have the camera begin recording and vice versa. You need to really look at the settings in the base unit (if you have the alarm system) to understand what options there are.
The camera comes well-packaged and the instructions are very straightforward, the camera is small and very easy to put up. This being said, I do believe it is overpriced, it should be the same amount as the indoor corded camera that is around $59. I have my motion notification settings on ""standard"", we'll see how the battery life goes, will probably get a solar panel for it at some point. The picture quality is pretty clear and the adjustability to get the angles you want are very easy to do with the basic mount it comes with, the package includes all the hardware needed to install it. I would suggest you have someone hold up the camera where you want to mount it at and then look at your phone to see what the view actually looks like BEFORE you actually mount it. The night pic on the camera is decent, a bit better then the DoorbellPro that I have, gives me a nice wide view of the porch, the driveway, part of the street in front of the house, all the way across the street to driveways for those houses. This was a pleasant surprise for such a small camera. The motion detection is simple, it allows you to adjust a zone that you want monitored fairly easily within the app. You will need to charge the battery fully prior to use, the pack has two lights on it, one amber, the amber one will go out once the battery is fully charged. Everything you need to set the camera up with comes in the box. It is small, but solid, camera weight less than 1 lb. I replaced a bullet style that I had with it. The two-way sound works good as well, it picked up a conversation my neighbor was having on his porch and of people walking past the house on the sidewalk. I will probably be getting a couple of more of these, just wish that Ring would bring the prices down a bit. Overall, pretty nifty little camera that does what I need it to do without having to run a bunch of wires all over the place.",4,0.9973,Positive,746
10,"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good.

Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday.

I gave it three stars because I like what is potentially capable of, and I am realistic about a brand new product on day one. It may take a little time to work out all the bugs so patience is required for the first few months.

I should also add that the support rep spoke very poor English and it really got to the point I just wanted to get her off the call. I probably understood about two out of three words from the representative. This was more disappointing to me than the actual failure, but she was able to help me get it resolved - with various request to repeat things.

Update day 2: Camera has disconnected from network again, which means I have to go out and push the setup button again and reconnect it to the network. I don't really want to call their support number again because that was such a painful experience. I really want this to work so I am going to have to think about how much patience I have versus my frustration and desire to return it.

End of day 2 update: after connecting to the network again this morning at 10:30, it had dropped off WiFi by my return at 5:00 pm. I also noted the battery is down to 75% after two days of “not working”. This is stretching even my patience.

Despite the issues I have experienced with this device, I remain a fan of Ring products. I did receive a nice note from Ring customer support offering additional assistance, but he only works on weekdays so I cannot pursue the issue until next Monday. In defense of Ring, they were extremely helpful with my doorbell last spring so I have high confidence this will be resolved - if I can handle the shorter than expected battery life.

Beginning of day 3: I placed the camera on my desk, about 3 feet from the wireless access point as a test to see if wifi signal strength is the culprit. Reconnected it to the WiFi network. Battery strength on this beginning of day 3 at 61%. Even if I get this working correctly, I don't believe the battery life will satisfy my expectations.

End of day 3. Disconnected from WiFi after a few hours, sitting right beside access point. Discounts signal strength issue. I will work with with support next week to figure this out.

FINAL UPDATE: After working with Ring support, they assessed the camera as faulty and had me return it for replacement. Sadly, the replacement worked exactly the same way. This suggests a problem on my network (even though two other Ring cameras are working fine) or a faulty batch of cameras. After working with Ring support again, they forwarded me to a second tier support rep. During our efforts, it stopped responding to the setup button so I was no longer able to work with this camera. At this point we returned the unit. I was disappointed with the battery life and since they couldn't product a unit that would work on my network I decided it was time to fold. I remain a fan of Ring products in general, but this second example of the ""Stick up cam"" failed before we could do any extensive diagnostics so we will never really know what the problem was. (oh - for you networking folks out there, I did set the camera's mac address to a reserved IP address in my DHCP server. Worked fine for the usual 5ish hours and then lost the network again.)",3,0.9881,Positive,684

12,"The new camera has a different setup for motion tracking. It doesn't use the boxes, instead it uses an Arc that doesn't even extend to 1/3 the image at MAX setting. It then has 3 zones within the arc that you can turn on or off. My Ring Doorbell senses motion at 4x the distance. and can be customized much more. I'm tempted to return this and just put another doorbell out there for better zone configuration.",2,0.3361,Positive,77
13,"I was able to set up the camera to my router within 15 mins. Everything seems to work fine except for one thing. If I reboot my router, the camera won't re-connect to the network. Other devices re-connect within 1 minute of the router coming back up. I had to reset the camera in order to get it to re-connect, twice already. During this not-connecting period, the battery drains about 10% over night.

Updated 11/13/2019: The camera continues to disconnect from my router for no apparent reasons (even when my router wasn't rebooted). This is the fourth time so far since Oct 26. Had to do a hard reset every time after waiting for more than 12 hours for the camera to reconnect. I have the camera up 10+ ft under the roof. It's a pain to do a hard reset and re-setup. Battery level drops from 100% to less than 45% (2.5 wks).

Updated 2/17/2020: I had to buy a whole new router in order to get this camera to connect and not use the battery like crazy. My nest door bell camera worked just fine with the old router. I also bought the older version of the camera from Costco. Here's one example of signal strength from all of them: the new version camera (-110dB), the older camera (-50dB), another older camera (-58dB). They're all in the same area.

So, I'd never buy this camera again.",1,-0.1027,Negative,238
14,"Camera itself works fine, the negative review is due to the redesign and deceiving / shady business practice.

The old design could be mounted just about any which way you could think of, then they do a ""redesign"" and it no longer comes with the ability to mount to the ceiling without the picture being upside down. You now have to buy an additional ceiling mount. This could easily be solved in the software adding a feature to rotate the video. Of course they don't highlight this change anywhere.

**Edit to the review, 1 star continues. Added a camera which started a trial on that camera on a location that had a protection plan already. This then kicked the other cameras off the protection plan, stopped them from recording an more and deleted all the old videos. Didn't even know it happened until I needed to use the video footage.",1,-0.5627,Negative,150
15,"I would have liked to give this camera a better rating. While set up was made difficult due to the lack of a user manual, the video is excellent. But BEWARE it will cost you at least $30 annually to see your video after the 30-day trial period ends. Without the video, all you get is a notification of motion in the area of the camera. Who needs a camera for that? I would have expected at least some period of time for video retention to see the video and perhaps download it. This is a deal breaker ... you should look for another camera manufacturer.",1,0.4215,Positive,106
16,I just installed my 3rd Gen Powered Stick Up cam. The motion zones are completely unusable. You can't select where you want to detect other than raising and lowering a half moon area.

17,"Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.
Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!
Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)

Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.",5,0.9873,Positive,310
18,"Despite having good WiFi Signal Strength on three networks, I could not make this camera work reliably. I chose it because I wanted to mount it inside to oversee my front door through a side pane of a bay window. Besides it's general unreliability, at night, through a window, the reflection off of glass made it functionally blind. I do have another ring unit, a flood light/security cam and it is mounted outside and works both reliably and 24/7. And on the same network as I attempted to use with the Ring Stick-up cam 2. This unit needs to be re-engineered.",1,-0.2278,Negative,101
19,These do not work nearly as well as Ring's previous versions. The motion detection is HORRIBLE. The whole purpose of getting this camera was to DETECT MOTION and so far I've only had two alerts after at least a couple dozen people have walked right in front of the camera. I will be returning this ASAP.,1,-0.4824,Negative,56
20,"I've used a couple of the first-gen Ring Stick-up Cams for a couple of years now. For what I paid, they've done the job pretty well, alerting us to activity on our front and back porches, though the picture quality could be better. When I saw this new version with nice bells and whistles for a lower price, I jumped on it to install on the second story of our home to capture the backyard (we have that older stick up cam on the back porch for the blind spot created by the awning).

Installation was much smoother than my first-gen cams as far as getting it prepared in the app, did not have any of the maddening issues that I had back then. Attaching the mount to the house was also simple. The camera took about 15 minutes to update its software and was ready to go. I like that I can link this camera to my existing back porch camera so that if it senses motion, the porch camera will automatically start recording, and vice versa.

The picture ... in daytime, it's great. You're not going to be able to make out someone's face from 30 yards, but it'll do for when they're closer, and is definitely clear enough to monitor things going on within its range. Unfortunately it still suffers from Ring's lackluster night vision. To be fair, our camera is positioned to where no one will ever be very close to it, and distance is probably not to be expected for a sub-$100 camera.

Overall I'm satisfied enough that I am buying two more -- one for our driveway, and another for the other side of the house. Ring's tradeoffs in picture clarity are acceptable to me due to the sane pricing of their products and services.

I don't have the Ring alarm system, so I can't speak of how it integrates with that.",4,0.9468,Positive,318
21,"I have a 2nd generation wired stick up cam. I decided to add a second camera and bought this new version of the stick up cam assuming that there would be some improvements over the older version. Boy was I wrong! The new camera is inferior to the 2nd generation in every way. The mount is a flimsy all plastic thing that can't be mounted overhead and allows for less adjustment than the old model. Instead of a dedicated outdoor power cord, this cam has a dual purpose cord with a connection in the middle that is guaranteed to allow moisture into the cord. The field of view of the camera is much smaller than the 2nd generation model and there's no way to adjust individual motion zones like you can on the 2nd generation. There's no option to set this camera to person only mode either. So if you adjust the motion sensitivity higher you get an alarm for every cat and bunny rabbit that cruises by and if you set the sensitivity lower you can drive a truck into the driveway and the camera doesn't see it. All in all this New version of the stick up cam is one big disappointment. I'd send it back if it wasn't so much trouble to uninstall the thing.
Update: My opinion of this camera hasn't changed but I would like to say that Ring customer service is excellent. After my original review Jason at Ring emailed me and offered to help. He offered to replace my camera with the older version of the stick up cam and I gladly accepted. It's nice to do business with a company that believes in customer satisfaction.",1,0.9786,Positive,283
22,"I think people are suckered into buying the name, which used to be branded as quality....NOT ANYMORE.
Doesn't always connect, I Have to hit the connect button over and over and over again. Then I just give up.
If it does connect, it's too late to see whatever the motion Detector picked up.
It will detect that FedEx or UPS has pulled up in front of the house, but then you don't see anything else. You don't see the driver or them pulling away. Because it stopped recording.
After 30 days you have to pay. For the cameras to record you can only live view well as mentioned above the motion detector will alert you there's motion. But by the time it connects you can't see anything. It's already over. Or gone.
So for $10 a month, you can get recording for 1 camera $120 a year. I bought three cameras. So this is just an ongoing expense.
The cameras I had before these were REOLINK. They had micro SD cards that could be viewed. Either live or take them out and look at them on your laptop. They were stored on an SD card.

26,"After I wrote this review, I was contacted by Jason from Ring on 12/20/2019, who offered to resolve my problems. One month, one replacement Stick Up Cam and one (free) Chime Pro later, we finally have a system that works! So Jason was fantastic, the system works well now, but it should NOT be this hard. I stick by my initial comments below - the regular support people were useless, and the Cam can be temperamental. So my advice to purchasers of this product is that it works well when it works, but be aware you may need additional technology (e.g. a Chime Pro), and you may want to keep Jason (help@ring.com) in mind if you run into issues...

_____________________________________________________________________________________
Firstly it took ages to set this up. The product support people are useless. I spoke or chatted with four of them. They are clearly just reading from a script, so they just tell you to do the same things over and over again, even if you did them 5 minutes ago and they didn't work.

Then this cam just started working for no good reason after many hours of trying, and after the nth time doing the same installation thing. Who knows why? I didn't do anything different.

So I breathed a sigh of relief and thought the worst was over. But no. Now it goes to ""sleep"" after a period of time (which can be anything from a few minutes to an hour), even though the app says everything is working, and nothing will wake it up, except taking the damn battery out and starting again.

And as I said, the support people are useless, they don't listen to what your problem actually is, and just repeat the same spiel over and over again.

It's a waste of time, a waste of money and a waste of effort.",4,-0.9373,Negative,310
27,I purchased these cameras before their release and was very excited to receive them. After my initial installation that went very well I began to become less and less pleased. My first and most frustrating issue is the motion detection zones. I completely understand how they work and how to adjust the parameters but their function does not match the settings. My street side camera which is pointed below the street with the motion zone 6'+ away from the street still picks up every car that drives by. My front door camera that has the motion controls maxed out will not pick up me walking down the sidewalk directly in front of it until I'm within 5' of the camera. Both cameras have proven to be frustrating at best and mostly useless for their intended purpose. But they look nice...,1,0.621,Positive,140

After two weeks of use, the stickup cam couldn't connect to my wifi extender while all my other devices are perfectly fine, including 3 other security outdoor devices.

Tried to reset the stickup cam but it couldn't connect to Ring 53 for setup, called technical support who instructed me to press the orange button for 25 seconds, finally the cam completed update, I was so happy to put it back up outside the garage, however, it lost connection with the wifi extender again, though still can do live view, but no motion alert.

At this point, I am disappointed and had spent enough time on this product, pack it up and return. Hope Ring will improve the product so I will purchase again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy to install and connected to my wifi in no time, the only problem is that the location of this camera is on the outside wall of my garage, far from my Internet modem/router, RSSi reading was 68-77, sometimes is hard to get it online. With the help of a wifi extender, I can improve the RSSI to 53 and now it works well.

There's a few seconds delay in reporting event or bringing it up to live view, but not a big problem for me.

This is the 2nd day after installation, so far so good, no problem at all. Battery during the day with solar panel is about 100%, will drop about 1% or less per hour after sundown, depends on usage I think.

This is an update of my review. On the 3rd day, there are two event recording had a completely black screen, cannot see anything but the letter ‘ring’ on the left side of the screen. There were also two events that had no alert or recording, that’s when my husband went in and out of the garage, there might be more missed event/alert that I didn’t know of.

Called Ring technical support, the technician just kept saying what she wanted to say, may be she was just reading her instruction manual, she didn’t listen closely to what I was trying to tell her. She asked me to delete and reinstalled the Ring app, unplug and reset my router, there’s nothing wrong with my WiFi signal, all my other devices were working well. Finally, I ran out of patience and asked for her supervisor, her supervisor asked me to take the camera down from the outside wall and reset it as a new device again, then it’s working, no more missing alert, however, the Motion Snooze function doesn’t work on the app, it says unavailable because Alert was turned off, but the alert was on. They couldn’t figure out why, this function is not important to me, so I didn’t want to spend more time on this issue.

Technical support was not very good, first of all, the back ground was very noisy with many people talking, connection was bad with static noise on and off. I asked why it’s so noisy at the background, then she did some adjustment and there was less background noise, I think she had her phone on speaker. The technician was not knowledgeable and not familiar with the product, it was a waste of time talking to her.

Today is the 4th day of use, found out that the recorded event footage takes a long time to process, need to wait at least a minute or more before you can view it, kind of inconvenient when you want to see what just happened right away, at least it should show a short preview of the event like other security cameras do.

Also, the sensitivity cannot be adjusted, even I move the sensitivity bar and the blue area becomes smaller, but it still alert me of an event when someone is walking outside of the blue area. Again, I don’t want to waste anymore time talking to their technical support, will give it few more days and see how it is.",2,0.9852,Positive,668
29,"I’d say this camera is good if you just want to see what’s happening around your house. I wouldn’t depend on it for a major security purpose. I have this hanging from the overhang by my garage at an slight angle about 9 ft from ground.

Daytime quality: Great.

Motion Detection: The daytime picture shows where the camera first picks up motion. It’s a similar distance if walking up from the street. If someone comes around the back side of my house to break in the parked car, it’s not being picked up. What I don’t understand is how you can make a doorbell that picks up every moving vehicle on the street, yet this doesn’t make it beyond 10ft for detection. Because of this, I have my doorbell set to pick up all the way to the street & also trigger this camera when motion is detected. It doesn’t do much good though since my entry is enclosed and the doorbell only picks up a small section.

Night vision: If you’re trying to get a good image of a criminal’s face at night, it’s not happening. (See image - not an actual criminal lol) Although my driveway does have great resolution, I guess because it’s not a moving object.

I would return it, but on our house, it was a pain trying to get the wire run through the attic so it’s not worth pulling down. I honestly think this camera probably has better quality at a face level, 90° angle, but the only way I would mount like that is from inside my house so it’s out of reach from theft/vandalism of the camera itself.",3,0.9561,Positive,277
30,"Have read a lot of the negative reviews but can't relate. This gen 3 is meeting expectations. Easy to set up and install. Just scan the QR code in their app. I like that I can activate a siren on demand. It has good night vision. Two way convo. And I'm able to adjust the motion sensitivity. I have also been extensively testing it (I receive almost instant notification of motion frequently) and the battery still has a full charge. Does it have a lot of additional bells and whistles like integrating with ring alarm...no. But I knew that already when I READ THE SPECS. Do you need to pay the $30 or $100 per year to record and save...yes. if you are okay with that, the price and features will satisfy and you will likely get a couple of more. For those having issues, maybe you should request a replacement. Quality Control is never 100% unfortunately. But If you are still having issues after that.....maybe its......",5,0.9679,Positive,167
31,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Update 30OCT (original review and first update follow this): I changed my recommendation opinion and recommend the camera now. It doesn’t have the best FOV so the motion detection isn’t the best, but if you utilize the camera to the best of it’s abilities (i.e. don’t try to use the camera mounted high to cover large swaths or property but rather keep it at ~7ft to cover your back porch or something) it does a decent job. It’s a cheaper camera compared to Arlo or some of the other Ring models so you should manage your expectations of it’s performance.

The WiFi signal strength has been sufficient. I initially thought I may have a problem but they seem to be working fine. That’s not to say that a Chime Pro wouldn’t help since I’m on the lower end for signal strength.

What I absolutely love about this camera is the customer support that comes with it. After my initial poor review, Ring customer support reached out to me in an effort to help and to pass feedback on to the design team. The representative that called me was professional, competent, and effective. My specific camera may have an issue, but they are ready to swap it out if none of the solutions work. Components can fail at any point, but as long as the customer support still backs it up, I still consider it a good product.

The solution the tech representative suggested was to perform a factory reset by holding down the setup button for 30 seconds with the battery in. Then, set up the camera as you did before. There's no need to remove the old camera from the app since it will get over-written after the factory reset. He mentioned that he's observed the freezing problem with this model, but so far the factory reset has solved it. It's a simple process that takes a few minutes so if you are having similar problems, I suggest you do this.

The tech rep even followed up to see how the cameras were doing after the factory reset, so like I already stated, the customer support is top notch.

Bottom line is that it’s a cheaper camera so don’t expect it to perform like the spot or floodlight models. However, it still performs sufficiently in proper use cases and has good video quality. The customer support is top notch and is what ultimately made me change my mind to recommend this camera.

Update 28OCT: I’ve upgraded the review to three since the motion detection has improved from the first few days and the fogginess was from an especially wet day. However, one of the cameras stopped working and now fails to detect anything, turn on with linked devices, or give any notifications. I’ve removed the camera and tried to reinstall it several times but it ends up in an endless “updating its software” loop. I’ve waited about 20-30 minutes for it to finish but it doesn’t. I can’t access the camera or any of its features until this “update” process finishes, which it won’t, unfortunately. It seems like I have a bad camera. Their support has reached out to me, which I appreciate, and I’m curious to what they are going to say.

I initially thought the motion detection was horrible but I consider it average now. It has a much narrower FOV than a lot of the other Ring or Arlo cameras. However, it’s a much cheaper camera than these alternatives but you get what you pay for. I’m not sure if it’s worth the money, though. I have a pair of other cameras I just purchased that I’m going to try out and return these if they perform well.

——————————-

Original Review:
I can not recommend this product, primarily because the motion sensing is bad. I’ve been testing two of these cameras the past 2 days in both day and night conditions and they work maybe 10% of the time. If you watch the video I’m including, I walk directly up to the camera, wave my hands, and absolutely nothing happens. I have daylight videos showing the same thing but I can only post one video per review.

Another problem I noticed is that the cameras have bad WiFi antennas. I placed the cameras in the same location of the Arlo cameras I’m trying to replace and the Ring cameras are having a connection problems where the Arlo ones were perfectly fine. Yes, I could add a Chime Pro, but that’s another $50 expense that could be better spent on a more expensive Arlo camera.

The cameras fogged over completely in the morning, but I live in Washington, which is incredibly wet. The Arlo cameras fared much better but they still had some fog issues.

I did like the integration it has with my other Ring products such as the doorbell and alarm system. The video was good as well. However, with the severe motion detection and WiFi problems, I can not recommend this product. I’m going to give it another few days and probably switch back to Arlo.",4,0.9969,Positive,859

In the end, they told me the problem was not the camera, it was my router because they were able to connect it through my
Cell phone hotspot. PLEASE, do yourself the favor and just order a replacement if you are having problems like me. As soon as I got my new replacement the new camera worked flawlessly.

And it would not get good internet signal sitting right next to router. The camera would detect motion but live view would not work. We checked the internet strength and it was good. So we tried the other camera. That one we got to work! Yayyy right? Wrong! It worked for a few hours pretty good. Then we reset the router and tried to connect the other camera. Same thing. Live view would not work. Signal strength was better this time. But guess what, now neither live view would work on the cameras.

UPDATE: In addition to adding a mesh system to the house, today I obtained a brand new modem from my service provider. The signals to the cameras improved and I now have two of three cameras not working. No live view. They go on line and off line as they feel the need apparently. DO NOT get these. I recommended these to my neighbors when they worked good for about 4 weeks. They ordered three and have since received them. They are fighting the same battle I am already. They’ve replaced routers twice and the modem. They are looking to return theirs as well. Had a co-worker who bought Arlos. His internet is much much slower than mine and he has his cameras spaced further away from his router than I do, much further. Guess what? He has had no issues at all. ZERO!

FINAL UPDATE: I know how frustrating this gets but I stumbled across EUFY cameras. These work great! I actually installed them in the exact same spot the ring cameras were (rings kept going offline because of “weak signal“). The connection is great and they are working fine. Homebase and two cams cost slightly more than two ring stick ups (like less than $20). Extremely pleased with EUFY.",1,0.9774,Positive,285

I contacted Ring support and they had me try a variety of things that ended up just wasting my time. The camera still does not work properly and Ring support offered no solution what so ever. I guess I am stuck with a horrible product and wasted my money on this thing. It is the worst security camera I have purchased and I will be replacing it as soon as possible. It will not be another Ring device.

UPDATE: I have figured out that this camera works ok as long as it is indoors. If you put it outside, it is just a round brick. Ring even sent me a replacement and it still does not work if outside.

I am sadly disappointed with Amazon for screwing the pooch on this one. I am sending them back. Since I didn't get the Echo DOT I decided to order from ""Ring"" directly for the same price (minus the DOT). So beware of the Solar ""Bundle"" what you see.....is NOT what you get at least for me.",1,-0.8778,Negative,209
42,"To start,

I’ve been a huge Ring fan for years and decided to switch my entire system from Nest to Ring. BIG MISTAKE! Let me tell you why.

First, the battery cameras are a great idea and I didn’t want to be putting wires outside of my new house and extension cords. Unbeknownst to me the battery life on this thing SUCKS. So, I ended up buying the solar panel which greatly increased the battery life. if you go on a long vacation you might not be safe with this security system

Wait, there’s more!

Last weekend I get a ring notification someone was in front of my door and one of my cameras picked up. Turns out someone was lingering around for a few minutes and messed with my car. I was so happy to know Ring did me right. I looked in the footage and WHAT???? it didn’t record the whole action. Ring DOES NOT have continuous recording and because of that the camera could not record long and the police couldn’t see the culprit trying to break in.

Ring records in small segments after detects motion but do not think this would be useful all the time. For me it wasn’t and I regret switching to Ring.

This is my honest review from someone who used to be a huge fan to soon rip this garbage out of my house.",1,0.9495,Positive,233
43,"I paid an electrician to install this outside on our garage wall, where no electric power was available. But I wasn't about to use a battery powered one that would result in me climbing a ladder to remove the battery, recharge it and then climb the ladder again to reinstall the battery. Long story short, this stick up cam only worked when it wanted to, which most often wasn't when I wanted it to. Said it was connected to my wi-fi, but kept blaming my phone. So...bought a Ring Spot Light cam (cost more) and replaced the Stick Up Cam...it works perfectly, as I would have expected. Also a better application as this area is not lighted at night. Must say Ring Customer Service, most notably, Heather, was outstanding...stuck with me while we tried different things to make the first one work. It didn't, but she is The Bomb.",2,0.9052,Positive,149
44,"Purchased two of these but so far only have put up one.

Purchased the battery version this way when the power goes out the cameras are still active as long as your router and modem are active. Our modem and router are on a UPS or a uninterrupted power supply so as long as the power the modem and router are working the video will the recorded when the cam motion sensor detects someone there.

My complaint is the mounting bass which is screw to the wall the mounting holes go horizontal but the studs in the garage are vertical. To make sure the two screws were in solidly mounted the base sideways. Not the best mounting because what is the bottom comes a bit away from the base.

Those who designed this should have considered putting another vertical hole in it as well, that the bracket could be mounted to a vertical 2 x 4 stud.

Will be also adding a DC power adapter with a smart plug to occasionally top off the charge on the battery so it's always fully charged.

According to ring you can't do this but I have already tried it and it works fine but the DC adapter that's available is a little too strong so you have turn off the power to prevent the battery from being overcharged.",4,0.8834,Positive,225
45,"1) The lack of customizable motion zones is a huge disappointment. If angled downwards, mounted ~9ft off the ground, it misses a lot of motion detection coverage towards the upper half of the lens. Wish it had motion zones similar to the Ring Doorbell Pro. Such a shame for an “all-new, gen 3” version of this camera. Is it wishful thinking to see a better motion detection zone coverage in future firmware updates?

2) It stops recording too soon even with the motion verification feature turned off.

3) Battery life is said to last 6 months to 1 year in the product info. At current battery drain rate, it’ll be 2 months max.",3,-0.5106,Negative,113
46,"I set up my camera yesterday around 1700hrs with a solar panel and the battery drained in less than 12 hrs to 0%. The app told me since the solar was plugged in to put it on wired and then the camera worked fine and had notifications from about 40 or more feet away. After HOURS on the phone with Ring Support, all they said it was a battery issue and to put it on battery mode and not wired and now I can barely get alerts 10 feet away from the camera. There should NOT be that much of a difference between wired and battery mode. Almost wish I would have paid for a more expensive camera maybe it would have worked better. Extremely disappointed in this product!",1,0.4949,Positive,129
47,"***update*** changed to 5 star, if you set the camera to battery mode and then plug in the power outlet, it keeps the battery charged at 100% allowing the camera to use hardwire and battery power for backup in the event power is cut. This works as I intended, just need to figure out the setting*** Descent camera, but I am a little frustrated at a couple things. First, the inside camera allows you to mount upside down and then flip the camera view in the app. This was my install plan with the outside cam, but the outside cams do not offer the video invert option in the app. They claim this is for motion sensing issues, but I suspect it is so they can sell you the additional top mount. The biggest issue I have is that the stick up cams can be used with battery or plug in, so I bought the extra batteries thinking they would charge when the power supply was plugged in (nope) and that they would work as a back-up power supply if power is lost (also nope) the batteries have to be removed to charge and you have to manually switch between battery power or power supply within the app. I basically wasted $40 on batteries I’ll never use. I have an outside outlet on a timer I use for Xmas lights and I wanted to use the same outlet for the camera thinking when the timer kicked off the battery would kick in keeping the camera live, nope, camera will not automatically revert to battery backup. Apparently they just made it so they can sell the same camera as either battery or power supply.. no point in having both without them working together and being automated, which is not the case. I also tried to research this before purchasing the batteries and I could not get a clear answer anywhere which I think is intentional. Otherwise this camera is as advertised, works well, picture and night vision are good and other features seem to work as described. Setup was easy.",5,-0.7708,Negative,349
48,"The system was easy to install. Everything went ok for a day then the outdoor camera started losing wifi connectivity. I was up on a ladder at least once a day for a week resetting the camera so it would function and I could use the app to view the monitored area. During that time I noticed a dark spot that seemed to be growing on the video the camera would record now and then. Enough was enough, I sent the camera back and exchanged it for a new one. That one does not have the same connectivity issues but it still has problems. It doesn't always record when there is motion. It will take a snapshot but won't notify that there is motion. (Probably the app more than the camera)

The app is a horrid mess. Constantly, freezing up or crashing. Half the time it won't connect to the camera. When I called customer support(what a joke) I was told it was my wifi signal and that I should install a extender. Um... I have a mesh system and the camera is on the outside of the wall directly behind the base unit of my wifi system. You can't get any closer. The camera is the only device set to have priority on the Wifi system. Every other item, from my robot vac, thermostat, computers, and tv, has zero problems with staying connected or functioning well with this Wifi system. Only Ring has a problem.

Today, again, the entire ring system has a major outage. Wow. Great security Ring. I pay for monitoring and I don't even know if that is functioning with a major outage. This system is horrible because of the app. You can't control your system without this app and the app is always malfunctioning.

If you buy this system, and I recommend you do not buy it, then get used to seeing what's in the photo when you go to your app and try to do anything with your system.

Completely inexcusable. This is supposed to be a security system. How secure is it if you can't view video recordings of your property or access your cameras and devices because the app is constantly failing.

I bought this system in May 2020 it is now Nov 2020 and this system has been a headache to operate almost daily. And what ever you do don't waste your time with Ring support. They are useless and the customer service is abhorrent. All they will do is tell you that it is your wifi ...that seems to be their standard answer for anything that goes wrong.

Since the product you purchase won't function without the app and the app is constantly failing it is important to note this shortcoming. It doesn't matter how easy the product is to install and use if the method you have to use to run the product constantly fails. It renders the entire system inoperable, easy install or not.",1,-0.9268,Negative,496
49,"I hooked it up, and immediately started having problems getting it to connect and getting a picture. I called up tech support. They worked with me for over an hour, trying different things. We got it to work, but the technician was not satisfied.

They sent me a new unit, hooked that up, and have not had a problem since. I like that the company stands behind their product.

Since then they did a software/hardware upgrade. It makes this wireless unit operate like their wired products. It allows me to set the coverage area, getting less recordings that are not helpful.

I also hooked it up with one of their solar cells. This provides me with a constant charge. I like that not having to haul out a ladder to recharge the battery!!!

I recommend this device!",5,0.9013,Positive,137
50,"After having device for 4 months it started showing ""critical low battery"" on the app. This is a constantly plugged in device. I called Ring support and they told me first that they would turn it over to engineering, then told me that they were working on it and tried to give me two options. The first was a ""work around"" to where I have to treat this device differently than the 3 other Ring products I have while I sit back and wait for them to do something to fix this. The second option was to buy a new battery, to which I explained I would have to climb up on the side of the house to swap a battery that I had no idea was not going to put me back in this same situation 4 months from now. Crappy support answer. I've put in for a warranty replacement, will update after that process runs its course.",1,-0.2732,Negative,159
51,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this, but this is my experience! I bought one of these to test out, and it works great. I hung it within the 30ft range from the wifi router, and it gets a clear a great signal. It works as expected. I purchased 3 more for around the outside of the house and they all work great. You have to have a good wifi signal and they recommend if you don't, to use a repeater. i don't have to do that in my circumstances (even though one of the cameras is located about 45 feet away and switches between weak and good signal. I can perform all setting changes on my phone which is great, and i can see all 4 cameras - live at any time. All my cameras are on the outside of the house. I can remotely activate an alarm if necessary, I've tested it and it works. I can talk through it as well. You can specify separate zones within each camera and turn off motion detection using your phone if you happen to be doing yard work for instance and don't want it to record so it doesn't waste battery. I love these cameras because my kids come home a few hours before i do from work and i can see them when they are outside the house. If something were to happen, at least it will be recorded. This won't prevent someone from breaking into my house, but they will sure as hell be on camera if they do. Also, it will cost $3/month to use the cloud recording option, and if you have more than 3 cameras like I do, i recommend the $100/yr for that service. It's worth it!",4,0.9936,Positive,296
52,"I dont really leave reviews on products but I sure do a lot of research on products I plan to buy. I rely a lot on reviews.
Im here today because despite some negative most recent reviews , I still bought this camera.
A lot of complaints about the battery. The battery comes not fully charged, I left it charging overnight. Next day it was fully charged and from the time I had it on to finally having it installed it was only drained by 1%. I dont have many notifications because where I live there isnt much activity going on but from 12pm this afternoon installed to midnight right now, still at 99%.
I tested out the sensitivity on the motion control and its great. I have a ring doorbell and its very similar. I would say this is a lot better because it has two modes , indoors and outdoors. I have it set for outdoors and the video quality is great. Great sound. Great notifications and sensitivity on the device.
Anyone who complains about the device or has issues with the device, im not so sure if they know exactly how to operate one or their expectations are way too high. I went with the battery instead of solar panel. My ring doorbell lasts about 3-4 weeks on a single charge. I dont expect the same from this outdoor camera but I know I wont be let down.
Great security camera and all honesty, great product.",5,0.9925,Positive,249
53,"Update:

Thanks to Jason of ring, i was able to get this matter resolved. He walked me through some troubleshooting and determined the camera was in fact dead and sent us a replacement.

So here are some basics if you are considering these cameras for yourself.

Alexia:

So when I first bought these for my grandmother, I had them working on my amazon account, but unfortunately at the time and possibly still as of writing this, there is no way to have motion alerts brought up on a single alexia. So I was getting alerts for both my camera and my grandmothers. To fix this i made her a amazon account of her own, and migrated her ring cameras to another account.

Battery:
My camera only needs the battery swapped out once every month unless there is a lot of traffic in front of my door.

I recommend buying an extra battery and when you know you will have to swap out, charge it the night before and change it in the morning. you'll be able to see how much battery is left via the app and Ring will email you when its time to charge as a reminder.

Solar Panel:
I had no luck with the solar panel given my location, I can only recommend a solar panel addition if you are in a really sunny area and/or the camera gets sun.

Plug in:
The Plug in comes with a cord and a outdoor adapter. The outdoor adapter can act as a extension cord that gives you a giant extra length of cord to give yourself some room to play with when setting it up inside or out.

54,"I bought this as part of the alarm system. For cellular backup, Ring uses AT&T if you buy it either on Amazon or ring. If you buy through a Verizon, it uses Verizon. If you don’t get AT&T signal at your house, then the alarm doesn’t work if your internet or power stop working. I spent hours on the phone with Ring. They will not send me a Verizon base station and told me to return everything and buy it from Verizon.

Here’s the kicker. I bought the alarm system and cameras when they were on Black Friday sale. So, not only do I have to take everything down and ship it, but also spend another $220 to rebuy it all from Verizon and reinstall it. Even though the only different part is the base station! All the equipment will be used, so Ring will lose more money on it than I do.

I am looking at competitors now. Arlo’s cameras are supposed to be better, and we don’t need an alarm anytime soon since it’s not like I can leave the house until the plague has subsided.",4,-0.869,Negative,188
55,We bought this to use in addition to the many trail cams we use around our property for security and for wildlife viewing. Our trail cams run circles around this. This Ring Cam is on our porch and it very seldom detects cars coming down our private road. We are greatly disappointed. We have the motion sensor adjusted to the lowest setting but it still fails greatly as a security cam.,2,-0.3614,Negative,71
56,"Bought this after learning about do-it-yourself security cameras. This Ring Stick up indoor outdoor security camera is a good quality security for $99. Firstly, I went to a geek tech store and bought a security cameras set and was completely disappointed with my experience and the marked up prices.
This camera is very easy to install yourself. The picture quality is great. The App is easy to navigate and for $99 you can see what’s happening in front of your property when you are away and added security when you are home. I recommend using the Ring stick up plug in security camera....comes with an 8ft and 22ft cord 30ft total... if you can drill a hole on the exterior to the inside of your home to reach a electrical outlet to plug this device in that is the best option without the hassle of recharging batteries. I tried the recharge battery mode and did not like it but if you do go the battery route make sure you get the correct solar panel (called Ring Super Solar Panel) that will help the battery life.
I understand some people can’t drill holes where they live and recharging battery mode with a solar panel is an ideal option for some. Hope this was helpful.",5,0.9899,Positive,213
57,"I finally caved and bought the Plug-In version of the camera. After installation it shows an error message that the battery is critically low and live view is not possible. This is the PLUG-IN version and it does NOT include a battery. Googling the issue you'll find many people with the same problem. Ring gives this as the solution:

""Confirm the device your have is the Stick Up Cam Plug-In, and that the battery is not installed in the device. If you have a battery operated Stick Up Cam, please create a new thread on your concern.

Next, ensure the power source field says power outlet or electrical socket.

Try removing the battery from the Stick Up Cam Plug-In, leaving it out for a minute or two, and then inserting the battery again. While this is a Plug-In device, you can twist the bottom of the compartment to remove and re-insert the battery if applicable.""

Note that they ask you to verify it has NO battery. Followed by the advice to remove the battery in the next sentence. Again, this is the plug-in version and it does not include a battery.

I do hope that they will release new firmware for their device, clearly the firmware it updated itself to is not meant for this camera. Unless you're planning on spending more money and getting a battery for your plug-in version I would not recommend buying one at this time.

Update: I decided to buy a battery to see if it resolves the issue w the battery. It didn't. And the battery wont charge up either. Made no difference. On top of that the camera starts recording a few seconds after beginning of motion and sometimes not at all. My kid riding her bike in front of it didn't set it off most of the time. So it's going back to Amazon and I am trying out a different brand. Bummer.",1,0.2633,Positive,321
58,"I didn't need a doorbell camera so I was looking for something I could mount somewhere on my porch. Setup and installation was very easy. The battery life has been great. I turned off notifications, which is supposed to help with battery life. The only 2 drawbacks I have seen is the Live Mode doesn't takes a while to come up, if it comes up at all, despite my router being less than 10 feet from the camera. The router is indoors and there is an exterior brick wall between the router and camera, but that shouldn't be enough to degrade the signal as much as it has. If I wanted to use live view to communicate with someone outside, I don't think it would be an effective option. The other drawback is that the video quality isn't great when you zoom in. So if someone walks by the house and does something to a vehicle, or the mailbox, it would be very hard to get enough detail to identify someone. I still recommend the product though, just know it may have some limitations that could be a showstopper for some use cases.",4,0.3749,Positive,193

60,"I purchased the 2 Pack of the Ring Stick Up Camera Plug-In, but I have only put up one of them at this point (long story). However, I wanted to write this review because I felt doing so might help some others trying to decide if they should buy Ring or not. First thing I have to say that when you receive something from Ring the packaging screams quality. No cheap of flimsy box; everything that is in the package is well protected and yet easy to get out.

Before I installed the camera I ordered a battery for backup. After installing the battery I set the camera up following the directions. The Ring android app made it extremely easy to get the camera connected to my network. Once that was done I took the camera outside and found the location where I wanted to install it based on the area of view I wanted covered. By the way, I did order one of the Ring ceiling mounts for it, but the more I looked at the area I wanted it to cover the more I realized that I could use the mount that came with the camera.

There is a single screw that holds the stand on. I removed it and moved the stand/mount to the back of the camera. In order to do this you do have to removed a weather seal where the mount needs to be placed; be sure to put the weather seal in the bottom of the camera where the stand/mount was located. It is easy to do, after removing the seal just place stand/mount in the hole, put the screw back in place and you are done. Took me less than a minute. I then marked the location where the detachable part of the mount need to go, drilled a couple of pilot holes, put the screws in and the base of the mount was in place. Snapped the camera into it and put in the security screw. After getting it mounted I plugged it in and it came right up. Used my phone to view and adjust it to cover the area I wanted covered and I was finished with mounting it. Probably took me a total of 10 minutes.

So, how does it work? Great. Since I already had the app open I went to the setting menu and turned on the Record Motion and Motion Alerts feature. I turned on Motion Verification and set the Motion Zones the way I wanted them. I then set the Motion Detection and I was done with the setup.

The camera has been up for 3 weeks now without any false motion notification, which is a great thing. My wife and I have looked at it quite often. It comes up quickly and the image is great for a security camera. If a friend or family member asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be absolutely.

The things that stand out in my mind are:
1. The quality of the packaging, but more importantly the quality of the product itself.
2. The ease of installation.
3. The features and function of the app and the camera.
4. The fact that I don't get false alerts, but at the same time it does alert me when it should.
5. Ease of use.",5,0.9961,Positive,560

The App will give a notification to my phone that there is motion, but when I open the app to view what that motion is I get the spinning circle of death at least 80% of the time! I had high hopes for this... Its battery operated, video quality when working is decent, but the entire point of having a device like this is to be able to view the video (and in real time...). This is 100% not the case here. It is just a failure of execution.",1,-0.7133,Negative,100
62,"I have a Netgear Nighthawk router and Netgear modem (100mbps download, 13 mbps upload, strong signal across my home and property) with a Ring security system and video doorbell and no previous connection issues with any other devices. I purchased two Ring stick up cameras, both of which failed to connect to my wifi network during set-up; at the point during setup where it attempts to connect to the wifi network it would fail with the message ""unable to connect due to a problem with your internet"" and flash a red-blue light. I methodically followed all the troubleshooting guidance on the Ring help page but this did not resolve the connection problem so I contacted Ring support, who simply followed the same troubleshooting process. After two separate calls with Ring support I was advised that there must be something wrong with the camera units and to exchange them. After exchanging for two new cameras I encountered the exact same connection failure and had no choice but to give up and return the cameras as both the troubleshooting guidance on Ring's website and technical support were not able to provide an explanation for the failure.

There is clearly some compatibility issue with my system/system components and the Ring stickup cameras that Ring's troubleshooting page and technical support is incapable of addressing. Given that other Ring components and every other device I use connects well, I have good network connectivity with settings in-line with Ring's setup instructions, and new modem and router, I have to assume that the problem lies with the camera design or software. After reviewing several online forums it seems that others are experiencing similar connection problems, so once again suggests poor design on Ring's part with this camera. It also seems that Ring technical support is essentially incapable of providing any help beyond what is already listed on the troubleshooting website, so if you've gone through the troubleshooting webpage I would suggest not wasting time calling the support line. In the end I wasted several hours troubleshooting this connection issue and would suggest to others that they simply cut to the chase and return the camera if they run into similar connection issues during setup.",1,-0.8068,Negative,367

I also bought the solar panel and didn't charge much even with DIRECT sunlight for several hours. It supposed to keep the battery charging 1 to 2 percent per day. I didn't see any good having the solar panel for that. So returned all the wireless cameras and solar panels. Don't waste your time and money on these products!

I was so excited to read all the positive reviews only to find that I was immensely disappointed in both the wireless stick up cam and solar panel duo. I don't get how they have such positive reviews!!

I will say the app is really cool and has great integration, as well as user friendly. But the product itself didn't meet my expectations. The picture quality is actually very good.

I have been copied in on literally hundreds of emails from user’s experiencing same. This has now been almost 3 weeks and Ring, (an Amazon Company, I think), does not appear to have any ability to fix it, much less issue a statement on their site that acknowledges the problem. I have several other Ring products, and have been very satisfied, however, I won’t be buying any more products or recommend any until they get their act together.",1,0.554,Positive,179
65,"In the past I purchased the first gen of the stick up cam for my driveway. Due to too much interference even with a WiFi extender, I ended up returning that camera. Now, due to someone or something in my backyard at 2am that my dog alerted me to, I decided to try this third gen. My back porch is much closer to the router so I was hoping it wouldn’t have issues.

Let’s start off with what can be improved. Previous Ring items I purchased included the drill bits necessary to mount into brick and concrete. This does not. However, the nails and anchors to fit into the drill bit I used for the ring doorbell. But if you don’t have one of those, you would be out of luck and need to purchase a masonry drill bit set. As for the motion sensor zones, there are three fields of detection that you can turn on or off. I just wish the range went further. What would be even better is if the motion sensor detection could be customized just like the front Ring doorbell. Furthermore, wifi connection is just okay. Though I did expect better since the router was just 15-20 feet away from the camera. However, even when the signal was considered weak, the camera did happen to still go to live view quickly and capture and notify me walking out onto the porch. Lastly, the battery does take a long time to charge. About 4-6 hours. I do recommend getting a second battery so you have one on hand when one gets low. When the system first started up I got a notification that battery was low. I thought it was odd but it then it corrected itself and is at 100% charge.

Now, on to the good stuff. Overall, I’m fairly impressed. This third gen has sturdier parts. First gen had a flimsy mount and face plate that could easily crack. This has a sturdy rubberized plate you mount to and the rest of the camera easily slides onto that. Set up was much faster than expected. Just a quick press of a button and scan of the QR code and it was done! You do have to wait about 5 minutes for the camera to do an internal update. I wish we could still post pictures with our reviews. The image quality is crystal clear. Day and night time. Even better than that of my Ring doorbell pro. Finally, I do love that they kept the feature that you can set off a siren from your phone. It’s not obnoxiously loud but loud enough to grab someone’s attention or scare off some crooks.",4,0.9947,Positive,449
66,After installing a new entry door on our home we decided to get into the camera doorbell game. We decided on the ring 2 doorbell. It worked so well that we decided to ditch our Front Point security system (still under contract mind you and paying monthly) and go all in with Ring ( security system full protection option/ doorbell / two stickup cams . We wanted full video surveillance outside of our home and went with the ring stick up cam plugin x’s 2 (latest edition). Set up was a breeze as I would have expected. I am kind of a tech nerd so to speak and generally understand technology. Worked well for around 7 hours then the trouble began. In almost 30 days I have yet to go a full 24 hours with both stick up cams running and not dropping out. I have spent two to three hours on the phone with Ring ( very responsive btw). This is on top of 8-12 hours troubleshooting on my own. I spent the amount of time I did because I wanted these to work so bad. They elevated my troubleshooting to the upper level and the same issues are happening. All they say is that it’s a network issue. I have a an rsssi (WiFi strength number) of 40 to a high of 50. Every time the cameras go to “sleep” I have to get out a 8 foot ladder in Ohio winter mind you and unscrew the bottom and put in set up mode and start all over. . I got the plug ins for this reason so I would not have to go out climb ladders and recharge batteries. I have zero issues with the doorbell dropping out. The WiFi mesh system In my home works flawlessly. The tech support leaned towards blaming the mesh but I’m sorry more than 30 devices in my home say otherwise . Never ever an issue. I will not be changing my network for two bad apples that won’t perform. Fortunately I am within my return window. Unfortunately I cannot deal with the performance and will have to return. What’s the point of video security if they only work intermittently. Sad.,1,-0.7452,Negative,370
67,"Motion detection, WiFi signal and night vision are great, my problem is that I purchased a “PLUG IN” stick up camera that after a while it’s showing a “low battery” message and because of that message, it’s not allowing me to connect to live view. I contacted Ring support and they couldn’t fix the problem and could not understand why it’s giving me a “low battery” message, so their fix is to send me a battery to install in the plug in camera. If the camera is a plug in and should be working properly without the need of a battery, what’s going to happen when the battery goes low, I guess I will have to recharge a battery for a plug in camera. They announce this as a plug in stick up cam, they should have stated that even thou it’s a plug in it’s going to need a battery. I am very disappointed with this purchase, I have other Ring products and they work fine but this one is disappointing, that’s why I give it a 2 star rating",2,-0.5785,Negative,181
68,"Unfortunately Ring doesn’t work through a window, get a Nest Cam (formerly DropCam) camera for that. This was my third Ring camera and the other two are outside which work fine. I tried to use the “Stick-up” Cam through my inside window to outside. Didn’t work so I researched and Ring says motion detection doesn’t work through a window. Live view will work, but that’s not why I bought it. They should disclose that in their description. Ring has a much lower price for monitoring, but it costs in video quality and information as it is “incident” driven in recording intervals. Nest monitoring storage is more expensive, but it is continuous recording. You don’t miss anything and it works through a window. I’ll keep my Rings, but there are reasons I have both systems.",3,-0.6124,Negative,134
69,"this is the Best camera that ring makes.

it is way better than doorbell3 which fails to connect for Live View most of the time, like 80% failure.

And the outdoor stickup cam is better than the spotlight cam which fails Live View about 20% of the time.

both of those other cams need and wifi signal extender to work at all. the outdoor stickup cams seem to work great without extenders most of the time.

even Live View woks 95% of the time. even in the same locations as the other failing cam types.

I have 4 of these outdoor stickup cams and all are good.

but the two doorbell3 Fail at Live View most of the time.

and the spotlight cam fails at Live view often but 1/4 as much as the doorbell3 fails.

But all the cams are great at capturing motion and will hook up instantly to cell phone to display the motion at the time it is in progress as long as you open the notification fast enough. but doing a Live View fails often on the doorbell3 and spotlight cam. only works well on stickup cam.

I wirked on these other cams Live View issues for many hours with support and replace one doorbell3 just to have the replacement do the same thing. Live View failures with an entender only 4 feet away on the otherside of a wood house.",5,-0.1655,Negative,236
70,"I have three other Ring devices and this is the first to disappoint. I just finished installing it and ran into a problem; The firmware sets a ""critically low battery"" warning, even though it has no battery. I purchased this one, like my previous one, to be hard-wired. And, it is. The software even acknowledges that it is a ""power outlet"" wired installation. The camera doesn't even ship with a battery.

After going to Ring.com for support, I found hundreds of others with the same issue. Ring is not fixing the issue, claiming instead that their pandemic response is limiting customer service. Could not help but notice that their billing department seems to be working well and that my card was charged instantly. The only response from Ring that was in the same neighborhood was one suggesting to remove the battery and reinsert it. You know; The battery that you did not buy so that you could hard-wire it?

Recommend waiting for an update to the firmware before purchasing this item.",1,0.0312,Neutral,171
71,"We've had an original Ring doorbell for several years now and had to get thru the various quirks with that product. We had a lot of fun with the initial novelty of it and it was handy to have. It also brought us a good sense of security knowing that the device was there to keep an eye on our home.

Ring replaced the first unit once the camera became defective within the first year, so that was nice. But to this day it's still very inconsistent as far as the connectivity. Can never tell if Live View will work. Our brand new router is only about 20 feet from it, we have the fastest internet and a brand new modem. We've been thru several modems and routers over the years as we constantly upgrade to have the best tech. Still, dealing with the same issues.

So back to the Stick Up Cam. The motion detection works pretty decent. The picture quality is pretty decent. However, the Live View again on this unit is just come and go. We've tried the other app, the Rapid Ring app, and what's funny is when the Live View on one unit is working, the other typically won't. $30 a year for each unit to use the recording capabilities, wish there was a subscription to make the dang Live View dependable.

The setup for these units is also very frustrating. When you have to try several times to connect the unit, even when the connection strength is good, you know there's something going on. No reason it should take 5 times to go thru setup in the same location with the same connection settings before it is willing to complete.

We really wanted to like this Ring system but when it comes time to upgrade down the line, if there are better options, we will definitely consider them.",3,0.9915,Positive,314
72,"Updated:
If you purchase a WiFi extender and place it right near the camera it does get a better signal. T he y should disclose this information in the description. Kind of annoying you have to buy extra equipment for this. The whole purpose is for it to be wireless meaning nothing plugged in. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless WiFi if you still need a WiFi device placed within a few week. If they’d work on this glitch it could easily be a 5-star product. 3-stars for all the issues and complications. It does work better now with the WiFi extender.
This is the second one I’ve tried. Worked great for the first few days. Then all of a sudden it would say “activating” while continuously circulating unavailable to show live view. Also says “error retry”. I think they screw you on the device if you don’t pay the monthly recording fee. I don’t need this to record. I just need the live view which doesn’t require a monthly plan. I called customer service 3x but they are clueless and useless. They tell you to delete the app and reactivate it which doesn’t work. Waste of money. Will only work sporadically. I checked my WiFi connection and it’s working fine with a good signal. I have no issue with any of my other devices on my home WiFi connection so there’s obviously a defect in these things. Very disappointing. I was hoping this would be a great device seeing it’s completely wireless.",3,-0.4465,Negative,256
73,"Ring is basically a bunch of over priced junk with sleek marketing. I have a Ring Doorbell that seemed to work pretty good for the first year and a half, or so I thought, and I added the Ring Stick Up Cam. Having two cameras now made me aware of how much motion each camera was missing on a regular basis. The Ring Stick Up Cam is on my driveway and the Ring Doorbell is obviously at my front door. Often the driveway cam will pick up motion and when the person walks to the front door...nothing on the doorbell cam unless they actually press the button. This happens in reverse also. It’s very “hit and miss”. Lag time to answer on the app is ridiculously slow. Now my Ring Doorbell takes itself off line on the regular and recently started ringing at random times all by itself. There is no security if the cameras only randomly work. Today, we packed a car in the driveway and drove out....absolutely no motion detected at all, I checked the app and it was online and gave me a Live View so it wasn’t a connection issue. Both cameras are hard wired and have excellent WiFi signal. I’ve adjusted settings and everything else I could possibly do without success. My guess is Rings server is subpar. A yearly subscription fee for what? Odds are if an actual crime occurs these cameras won’t pick it up. Packages get delivered and Ring detects nothing, so obviously a thief could just as easily steal the package without triggering motion detection. So my advice is save your money for something else if you want a true security system....this isn’t it!",5,-0.5251,Negative,283

So far everything seems to be the same except there’s no POIE capability (not really a big issue for me) and there’s NO CEILING MOUNT!! Sure enough I found out that I need to purchase said mount separately as opposed to it coming with the camera. Wouldn’t have been an issue had they been very clear it no longer comes with this mount and that you need to buy one if you want to mount it on the ceiling but now I’m stuck trying to figure out how to make this work before leaving for a work trip...thanks for wasting my time.",2,-0.8012,Negative,123
75,"We already use a ring front door camera. It’s worked so well and it’s easier just to stick to the same brand for home security. We wanted a camera that could be used inside or out since on limited budget. This does the job.
If my kids are outside in our backyard I just place it on a chair or picnic table. It easily covers the width of our yard which isn’t that small. It comes in handy for “crowd control.” What I mean is when their friends from the neighborhood come over to play I just friendly remind all the kids that the camera eye sees all. I haven’t had to use any recordings to resolve any issues and hope to never have too.
The camera is used mostly indoors and I put it In the a certain spot that sees mostly our living room and kitchen. That way I can check in on our dogs when not home. They can hear me talking to them and one of them usually will walk up to it. By now they’re used to it.
For the price and to get a working idea on where I might stick outside or inside cameras this camera is great. No need to screw anything. I usually just use some tape just to try out camera positions. Basically dry runs till I bite the bullet and buy more.
If undecided about what to do this option is perfect. Especially for being on limited budget. The duality use is great. Drawback is yes the remembering to bring it outside and inside.",5,0.9857,Positive,265
76,"UPDATE: Update - I updated my review from four to one stars. Here's the reason why. I have a RING Stickup and a RING Spotlight covering our pool and backyard. Both are battery powered with attached solar units. I've had some issue with the company that chemically treats our yard for weeds etc. I knew they were coming a few days ago, so when I got home I pulled up the videos from our backyard (the aforementioned cameras). One recorded him coming into the backyard but not leaving. The other didn't record him or alert that someone had entered a motion zone (it was obvious from the one camera that he had in fact entered motion zones for both cameras). I called RING Tech support and spoke with Mel. Pleasant enough guy but not helpful. We started with the discovery my recorded length was 20sec when it should have been 30 which is the default. I asked where I could change that and he gave me instructions, but the options he quoted were not available on any of my cameras. He told me to delete the app and reinstall. I did but still no joy. He then said he could change it from their end. Then we discussed zone settings and he said my RING Stickup camera had five zones with one turned off. None of my cameras have five zones, they all have three. I asked him for clarification and he repeated ""from my end, I see five zones on the stick up camera and one is turned off). Now, how does he see five zones and I see three? We then tried to trouble shoot why the cameras were detecting motion but not recording. NO CLUE, said he would have to escalate the problem (means throw in the white towel) but said he would send me an email outlining our discussion and assuring me he would continue to trouble shoot. Got the email - basically said I should consider two step authentication (which I already had set up). Replied that I was not satisfied and the one time I really needed the RING to work, it didn't. He did reply and restated he was going to continue troubleshooting the issue. Long story short - three of my battery RING cameras have proven unreliable. The only one that seems to work worth a darn is the wired RING door bell. Total waste of money.

Not an easy install because of the limited movement allowed by the base. Speaker is terrible and this is for either hearing what is going outside or speaking to whomever is in camera range. Would not buy this model RING again.",1,-0.9636,Negative,446
77,"After the 30 trial the unit becomes Worthless, it will only operate as a live view and not record anything. I bought it to keep an eye on my 90 Year Old mother. If the alarm rings by the time you get up and find your phone, turn it on to the live view you might see nothing but an empty bed.... did she Fall, go potty, wandering around the house. You'll not be able to reference back to see what happened.
So get on line and go through the extortion! It's $3 a month or $30 a year to make it of any value at all. Hope your credit card doesn't expire or you switch banks?

Update.... Returned for credit
So what if your in a meeting, driving, at work or in the middle of a 20' putt for $50.00? Maybe someone just stole your new TV off your porch? You won't be able to go back and see what was delivered or which neighbor grabbed it 2 minutes behind the UPS driver or was it just the cat?

78,"At first this stick up cam worked great for my front door but after I moved it to the bedroom area for some reason it stopped responding and kept getting an ip address conflict. My two other indoor cam and elite cam outdoors (which replaced this) had zero issues since day one. I even tried doing a hard reset and setting it up again. It started working fine after that but the fact that it started giving me these issues discouraged me from wanting to keep it.

In doors? Get the indoor cam. Outdoors? Get the elite. The one thing I do like about this version camera is that it comes with a nice long cable that extends for power. I am not a fan of battery powered devices. I don't want to keep going back to a device to replace and recharge battery every few months for most of the day.

One aspect I do not like about this camera is the fact that it has no motion zones that you can customize. You can only turn off 3 different zones and increase it's sensitivity/range, that's it....that was a bummer. The indoor cam has this AND has color night vision. Same with the elite that I got for outdoors. Kinda disappointed with this one but it's likely I may have gotten a bad one and need to get a replacement. The device should not act up just because I moved it's location and it needed a hard reset. For now I will return and maybe i'll get a new one later.",4,-0.8888,Negative,262
79,"Updated review:
Jason from Ring reached out to me and told me about the new Mode feature that will include cameras coming out soon and he was able to get me access to beta test this feature and so far it's looking great!

Now when I go into Modes you will see a cameras section where you can enable or disable both motion detection and live view separately.

I just started playing with it but so far I have it set up so that everything for the cameras are enabled when my mode is set to Away or Home (home is sleeping for us and the cameras are downstairs while we sleep upstairs so we want them on).
When the mode is Disarmed (we're at home and active) I have Motion Detection off, which I assume means I won't be getting notifications, but I left Live View (spying) on for my wife...

As mentioned I am testing a beta version of this so it may not work exactly as I described once it's released but even as it is now it's looking great and I'm really happy Rings has been working on this. I know they want to get it out this year but I don't know any more than that.

Original review:
I couldn't agree more with the review(s) that point this out. Why am I receiving 100 notification a minute from my living room camera when I just told the Ring app we're home? It would be pretty bad if you had to go in and configure that instead of it being the default but you can't even do that because it's not there. The alarm and cameras don't seem to even know each other exist.

As far as the cameras themselves go, they're fine. I do really like the battery packs and how easy it is to swap them out but expect to pay another $30 for each camera for a spare battery unless you want them offline for a few hours every so often.

If you just have the doorbell and want to add some more cameras these are probably great. On the other hand if you're looking for a complete subscription security solution, Ring is almost useless and I would avoid it until they add some basic integration between their devices.",4,0.9925,Positive,386
80,"Let me start with this being a nice camera, with some issues, but manageable.

The biggest issue with our outdoor outlet model is that the system is not angle-able, mostly. Wherever you place it just make sure it's almost perfectly pointed the area you want to cover because it's not designed to be pointed down more than maybe 10 degrees or to the side more than about 15 degrees. I have to make a wedge to remount it properly.

Where the AC adapter plugs I to the back I'm not exactly reassured in any way that water won't get into the electrical port.

Don't expect it to capture a license plate more than 10-15 feet away.

It will ignore motion detection instances on purpose and you have to actually change the settings to report ALL motion detection moments. Beyond that, it's more than sensitive enough to detect people walking 200 feet away and the mic pics up even subtle, quiet sounds.

It is a pain to setup as there are multiple steps that are not integrated in the startup process. The image quality is decent and the mount feels like it's pretty durable.

The pluses are numerous once the limitations are compensated for. The software is overly complex and sometimes crashes (apple and android) but it works, and working is more important than intuitiveness in my opinion.",4,0.8824,Positive,227

This ring step stick up camera has frustrated me beyond anything I could ever begin to tell you. After going around with the ring every single day this past week I finally found a technician who somewhat started to make sense. He felt it was my internet speed so initially he said it was the upload speed And then after that didn't work he then said it was the download speed. But I do believe we were in I contacted my internet provider and I had them increase my download and my upload speed That did not work Then today I had them send a technician out to look over what was going on with my wireless box my wired box my router and outside aspects.the right He spent 2 hours here He rewired he changed out boxes He replaced my modem to the most current modem they have and I am pleasantly surprised to say that everything has been working for the last 10 hours. That is the longest that camera has worked. So quite obviously it was my internet. I just wished ring instead of keep sending me out cameras had initially said you know your Wi-Fi it could be your Wi-Fi and that isn't what occurred up until the last couple of conversations. So if you're having issues with that stick up camera it could be your Wi-Fi. My ring doorbell has been perfect from day one never an issue That was wired this stick up camera is solar I don't know if that has anything to do with it but truly the issue was my Wi-Fi so I wanted to be able to update everybody. Cuz my last couple have not been very nice or very good. So I love the ring stick up camera premise it is now working great and I upgraded my star review to four stars. If anything changes I will come back and update.area of the issue.
February 9th 2020 update.
This is the most unstable camera I have ever used. every day since this has been installed I have called ring because the camera goes offline or it takes an hour and a half to reset itself. last time I called I was on the phone with them for an hour and a half and they said that the device was defective. They sent me out a new one that was installed yesterday. At 4 p.m. by 6:25 p.m. the camera was not working again. I called ring this morning and it went from defective camera to it's my internet. If that were the case and it's my internet the ring security system wouldn't be working the ring chime wouldn't be working the ring doorbell 2 wouldn't be working my cell phone wouldn't be working my TV wouldn't be working etc etc etc. I'm ready to fling this flipping thing cuz I'm just playing tired. I called this morning and had to escalate my call to a manager while they're very nice at ring and I've said that from the get-go when somebody calls you every day for two weeks with the same issue and then today you're being told after all this time that it's not their camera and now it's my internet and it could be a firewall and it could be this then wouldn't it firewall for every single ring product that I have which is multiple? So I finally got the manager to agree to send somebody out here to figure this out. I am legally blind this morning's phone call was they wanted me to climb a ladder and reset the camera which is about 10 feet up. No can do. On top of that I've paid somebody three times to come out here to install their products to replace the cameras to install the cameras I can't keep doing this.They have agreed to send me a coupon code and communicate with Amazon home and they will send somebody outwell I'm very appreciative that they are doing this I am so frustrated with this camera. At this point I would not recommend that camera for all the money in the world now the other ring products that I have I think they're awesome. So I will update as time goes on if this can't be resolved then I'm going to send that camera back because it's worthless to me. so I dropped my review from a 5 to a 2 at this point and we'll see what happens
I had a ring stick cam solar and a ring doorbell two wired installed last Saturday. The video is awesome the motion detection is excellent not going to lie and say I don't get some false rings but that's okay it's not a lot. What I really like is the ability with both the stick cam and the doorbell to speak to somebody who's at my door. Excellent sound excellent quality of each item. I would highly recommend and as a result of this installation I am going to do the security system for the inside of my house.

Sometimes two people can be walking 5 to 10 seconds apart one after the other and you won’t see detection until the second person pops up into view. The first person is already exiting the area. I have had strangers come to the property to leave ads or packages and I only get to see them as they leave, missing footage from entering the same line of sight in broad daylight. I am only aware that someone entered by spotting them in another cam or scrolling through the pictures. I already have three of these cams.

I mounted it on the side of the house under the eaves. Physical mounting was very easy, and the cord was long enough to reach through the eaves to an outlet in the attic without needing an extension cord. The ball-and-socket joint in the mount allowed sufficient angle adjustment that I didn't need a separate mounting bracket. The angle of coverage is generous, the image is crisp, and the Infrared night vision is incredible. It's easy to connect to WiFi, although be advised: when first connecting, it upgrades the software and tells you it could take up to 5 minutes. Mine took 10-15 minutes with a high-speed router, so be patient. There is also a wide range of parameters for the camera you can set with the Ring app, making it even more versatile.

Ring is RIDDLED with bugs and lag issues that'll you wont feel the mayor impact of until your return period is up!
For the few months you may think ""Oh this isn't too bad, it works"" and then later (actually not that much later I've only had it since about August) the problems begin to ""set in""... And then so does the regret. I've already had several incidents THIS MONTH where a neighbors car that was parked almost perfectly in view was vandalized and all Ring could pick up was the moment where the person drove off, because the motion sensing is SO DELAYED I bet if you ran or even rode a bike fast enough past a Ring cam one could avoid being detected COMPLETELY...Which is exactly what happened the SECOND time my neighbors car got vandalized... So with that I URGE EVERYONE whose looking into home security...please..DO YOUR RESEARCH..DON'T just settle on the ""popular"" brand.

86,"Pros:
1. Motion detection works well, if you set it up with motion verification, and once set, it picks up as soon as a corner of my coat was in the zone, so it records the whole motion, while the Arlo pro has serious lag sometimes records video with the person already left the view.
2. Batter life seems to be good, I didn't have it fully charged, like only 53%, and after 4 days, it triggered around 40 times (mostly we walked in and out of the house), and it still has 40% juice.
3. day light image is good
4. won't send false alert for tree branches or falling leaf
5. I don't have a paid subscription for cloud storage, but so far, whenever I got an alert, I was able to go into the app and see the complete video, not a snapshot like Nest which is useless if you don't pay
Cons:
1. Wifi connection setup has some problem using the app, it said to have connected, but won't show any video, finally figured out to go to setup and connect, then it REALLY was connected
2. Motion Verification is a better and duplicated function of Privacy Zone; Privacy Zone block the areas (2 only) that you don't want to monitor, Motion Verification select the area you want to monitor, and Privacy Zone shows you a video with black boxes that is really annoying
3. Night vision is quirky, when there is street light with IR turned on, it is showing dark screen, turn the IR off, the picture looks better
4. Wall mount base is plastic, so if you mount is on a uneven surface, you will have hard time pushing the camera in, due to the base will flex and the notches are not flat to align the bottom of the camera

So far, it is doing what I want in a wireless camera, which is monitor only the area and not sending false alert, the others either failed or need to pay for the feature, so I was going to give it a five star, but little Cons above drops 1 star.

All in all, still a good buy for the features.",4,-0.7702,Negative,369
87,"Have this on solar power. So installed by the roof to get the sun, and away from tree. The application is unstable, and get confuse, when you use the scheduling mode. It never went back to normal after I used the schedule mode for motion. I did not sign up for the subscription. I purchased this late Oct 2019. I have the floodlight with the subscription. It was great in the beginning (installed 2017?) but the updated firmware, or what they claim enhancement, also caused the application to be confused. Was addressed to Ring, but the light quit turning on when motion is detected and recorded at night. My issue is, when I changed network after getting a new provider. To change your wifi network, you have to press reset button on the camera that is installed way up there by the roof. I have other security cameras, I do not have to press any button to change the network name. It is all done in the app. Their excuse is for security. Really??? Your security of more revenue?

89,"UPDATE: Shortly after my original post I discovered I had missed the detail about needing to purchase a ceiling mount in the Amazon ad...so that’s on me. In addition I unexpectedly received an email and subsequent phone call from a Ring rep, Jason, who asked how he they could help with my problem...when’s the last you had a company do that...for me it’s been long time and frankly the very helpful conversation restored my confidence in Ring as a company. I will gladly do business with Ring in the future.
ORIGINAL POST
The RING Stick-Up camera is my second RING product and I recently set it up(which went quite easily) and installed the camera on my ceiling. But now I'm much less of a RING fan! WHY...the videofeed is UPSIDE DOWN...at first I thought no problem there's surely ae a rotation setting in the app(BTW there is for their other camera system) but after looking everywhere for a rotation switch on the Stick-UP I discover there is NONE and the only way to mount it on the ceiling(even though their ads and info all show it that way)...is to buy an optional $20 mount from RING to do so...
At least now I understand how the product got it's name...",1,0.9629,Positive,210
90,"We purchased the Ring Stick-up Cams w Battery to replace the Swann Security Camera system, which is about 15 years old and beginning to fail. The Ring Stick-up Cams w Battery seem to work fine - a lot like the Ring Doorbell 2 w Battery.

The setup was fairly easy... but... most likely, you will have a bit of difficulty getting it to link to your wifi and to join the Ring network. I followed the setup instructions exactly... and... it seemed to connect to our ATT wifi network fine (about 30-40 feet away through walls)... but... it wouldn't complete the connection to the Ring network, without some intervention, which should have been in the instructions, or easily found on the Ring web site. I couldn't find the solution, without calling Ring Customer Service. But... with their help... I easily completed the setup and the cam seems to work fine.

It takes a few minutes for the firmware to update automatically, and then seems to hang on completing the connection to the Ring network. Even after following the instructions to ""reset"" the device, it still had problems connecting. Ultimately, after a couple of attempts, I had to remove the battery and reboot the device. Once I had completed that process, it connected to the Ring network and began working just like the Ring Doorbell.

It's working fine now.

I'll try to remember to update this review, after it's worked successfully for several months. We've had the Ring Doorbell for 18-24 months, and it has constinued to work fine - hopefully - the Ring Stick-up Cams w Battery will as well. We shall see.",5,0.9789,Positive,273
91,"I purchased a second battery cam on Jan 9th 2020, my first battery cam was purchased back in April 2019. This new version has not functioned reliably since installation. Live view does not load consistently and the motion detection is intermittent. I have been on the chat with Ring support (which is very good) and gone through the typical troubleshooting steps. At this point, they are ""going to get back to me"" with a possible fix. I am not sure what they intend to do, but it is very obvious they cost reduced this new version with a severe impact in reliability and functionality. My first battery cam purchased back in April 2019 works flawlessly, it is very unfortunate that Ring decided to ruin their reputation for a few extra gross margin points.
-------UPDATE March 16,2020---------
After working with Ring customer service, the issue was resolved. A new firmware was released that resolved the live view issue. The new camera works as well as my previous camera and is fully functional. Normally a 4 star would be warranted, however, the customer service by Ring sets the bar for excellent customer support in my opinion so I am updating with a 5 star rating.",5,0.0454,Neutral,203

93,"Didn’t want to give a review until I’d have it a few months, I actually bought 2. One for my front, one for the back yard. And I have to say, I’m more impressed than I expected. I was worried the most about the battery life. I live in a relatively busy area and one is set on my dog’s kennel he runs in and out of throughout the day, and the first time I had to charge either battery was 3 months in. And it doesn’t take long to charge at all! Super easy to remove and put back in. The motion sensitivity settings are incredibly useful for the different areas, and the live view and two-way talk works well. I have a very high-speed internet connection, so I’m assuming the bad reviews have a lot to do with an internet connection that can’t keep up. Setting up took literally 10 mins, had no problems there, and they seem to work well in both high heat, direct sunlight, as well as bitter cold. Snow and rain don’t have any effect on them that I can tell so far. Very pleased. Considering buying more.",5,0.9476,Positive,194
94,"I have two of these. Bought within two months of each other and the same model. However, they are very different from each other with the user interface.
Cons:
- Live view is horrible. Because you are not connecting to your camera directly, rather, connecting to your camera via the internet and then circle back to your camera, often times it simply will not link up. Motion detection alerts you to an activity. By the time you can actually see live, the bad guy has beat to blob and stole your house.
- 30 to 60 seconds of recording time. As I said, two cameras, two months apart and the first one records up to 60 seconds. The newer one only 30 seconds. Either way it's BS because 60 seconds of recording will only prove to the court that a person was caught on your property and no proof that they beat to a blob and stole your house.
- Price. For the first two items, this product is not worth the money.
I cannot recommend this product until they fix the first two issues... make connectivity instant and increase the recording time for as long as there is activity sensed by the camera.",2,-0.865,Negative,204
95,"I really wanted to like this device as I have a lot of other Amazon services that I currently use and though this would tie in nicely. I liked the size of this camera and the ease of use and setup. It is on the larger side as it is about the size of a soup can.

The biggest complaint I have is that you cannot deactivate the blue indicator light on the device when it detects motion or when you are viewing the live view. Now others have said to just put a piece of black electrical tap on it but who really wants to buy a camera that you have to modify right out of the box. This could easily be done in the software to enable or disable that indicator led, it is so bright others notice the camera and it is distracting when you are outside in the dark, all you see is this bright blue led.

The other thing is if you want to mount this on the ceiling you have to order a separate mount, which it should come with. There is a universal mount adapter which they should just include in the packaging in the first place.

Their is not charger that ships with the device, yes it comes with a USB charging cable but not the wall adapter you have to have your own or go buy one separately in order to charge the battery.",1,0.9648,Positive,243
96,"I got this because my neighbor and his guests are usually up all night making noise, have come on my property and broken into my car. The sheriff says I have no proof and is either too scared or lazy to answer a call. The deputy told me to get this camera, so I did.

Since then, the neighbors have stopped parking their cars in front of my driveway and seem terrified by the very presence of my camera (he keeps adding layers to the fence). But other than that, it doesn't actually seem to work. I hear loud noises outside and try to see if anyone is there. It often takes 10 or more seconds for the ""live view"" to work, so if I did want to catch anything on camera, that time is lost. That's more than enough time for someone to completely pass by and go into the back yard undetected. Other times, live view just simply crashes. You just never know when its going to let you actually use it and see what's happening.

All the more reason to have an actual functioning motion detection. I have it set as sensitive as it can be, So its going off every minute during the day, but picks up nothing at night, ever. I have a camera by another brand that is picking up a lot of activity in the street all night long. My neighbor sets that camera off a minimum of five times a night. So I have no ""proof"" from,my Ring camera for law enforcement when something happens.

Overall, the whole ring/law enforcement relationship is sketchy to begin with. Everyone knows these are privacy nightmares. Its more expensive than other cameras and makes you pay a minimum of $3 a month to be able to keep your recordings. You can only see them on your cell phone. I don't even want to think about what information the Ring app is collecting from my phone. It claims to be the best and it doesn't really work, at least not anywhere near the level it should for the cost in both money and privacy. The only positive I have is the video and audio quality is way better than my other cameras, but useless if it doesnt record anything at night.

When I searched to see if other people have this problem, they do, so apparently its not just my camera. Most crime happens at night, so a security camera needs to be able to work then. That's a given. I wouldn't know that this camera doesn't work if it wasn't for the fact that my other cameras do. I guess ignorance is bliss, but that's not why we buy security cameras.",1,-0.1376,Negative,455
97,"I have several ring cameras installed already outside my home. It's been a frustrating and dissatisfying experience to say the least. While I won't go into the many, many issues I've had with my system overallI will point out a few very specific ones related to this camera. I'm an IP network engineer with over 25 years experience and fully understand every aspect of how these cameras work and interact with the cloud. So for starters, if you are going to pair this camera with the solar panel for charging, take my advice and install the camera and solar panel first, connect them to each other THEN scan the barcode that came with the camera and add it to your system. If you charge the battery and add the camera before connecting the solar panel, the camera comes up in ""battery"" mode. The alerts are so limited I was literally standing in front of the camera maybe 10 feet away and waving my arms and it wouldn't alert. Think of your phone when it goes into power save mode for low battery. The video quality is reduced. Not sure why anyone would want this. But here is the major problem and why this camera gets one star and a bad review. When I installed it and brought it online and adjusted the settings to my liking, it went off line for about 15 minutes to update it's firmware. So no alerts, no ability to do a live view, when you try the app tells you to wait until it's done updating. OK I get that, updates are release and need to be installed. I've now had this camera working for about 5 days and every single frigging day, it goes off line and updates it's firmware. When I do a health check with app it tells me the firmware is up to date, but despite this, like clock work, it goes off line and updates again the next day. Another issue I don't like... I have serveral other stick up battery camera with solar panels outside, they all have the same settings and status information when I access them through the app. Not this one. The status shows similar but different information. Obviously RING has changed or switched who makes these things for them and they just don't operate the same as ones I installed a year ago. Overall, RING is a cheap and easy alternative to a true professional grade wired system. You get the convenience of a somewhat easier installation and some decent features but the trade off is a quirky, unreliable system that misses events, freezes while recording, and often is totally undependable when you try to do a live view. For example you hear a noise outside and go to access the camera in that area to live view what is happening. More often than not, the system times out and comes back with ""streaming error"" and by the time you actually connect, what ever alerted you is gone. I actually contacted Ring tech support and told them I ran a wireshark capture of my home internet connection and every time the a camera timed out, it was because the RING ""cloud"" system and network failed to respond. Their support didn't know what to say other than give me a bunch of lip service about how they could work with me to fix it. Really, when the problem is your cloud servers failing to respond or even sometimes records videos for hours, how is working with me going to fix that? We are in the process of building a new home and you can bet for sure I will not install a RING system and will go with a true professional grade system that is hard wired.",1,-0.8911,Negative,631
98,"It worked perfectly, meaning I never had 'video unavailable' ie the black 'empty space' where it should've captured video during my free month. However once I signed up for the $30 plan within a week I was getting more 'video unavailable' sections during the day. Of late that is happens less than it did initially but it will still somehow not record people entering my property, like the other day when UPS came to my house twice and I have zero footage of it from the camera.

Motion detection is bad, the people mode doesn't work, despite setting my motion zones it still triggers on cars or branches moving. It also primarily only works on people walking left to right and misses 95%+ motion of people walking right to left, same zone it just can't recognize people coming from the other direction. It also misses motion completely, I've had delivery people come and they aren't even captured, well within the motion zone I set but somehow the camera didn't record anything nor do they appear in the 'non triggered' recording. This has happened enough to make that monitoring unreliable.

My router is less than 8 feet from the camera with a single wall with no heavy insulation or anything to block the signal and plenty of bandwidth for my internet usage, people will try to say my issues are due to a poor signal that is not the case.

The alerts are annoying as well and the app is pretty awful. You get alerts for motion a couple seconds after it is detected so if it was detected late which also means the video is low quality until a few seconds into the recording, the actual cause could be gone like the delivery drivers entering my motion zones and leaving so by the time the app spins up to go 'live' there's no one there and you never see anything. I also don't get any recording when I went 'live' to answer the motion detected, when I did nothing I'd at least see the 'motion detected' recording that I didn't view at the time so there is some record of the event.

I tried multiple times tweaking my motion zone and settings I still get alerts for everyone that walks by my camera but will completely miss people entering my property, ie the come toward the camera vs just walking past it, at least if they walk left to right.

Nightvision is poor like most cameras you need an extra normal lightsource or an infrared light to actually see in the dark, unless you expect to only view things within a few feet of the camera as that is the real range of the nightvision light it can produce.

I wanted to add a layer of 'plug and play' security/monitoring to my home the ring is so unreliable by itself, if you have alternative options consider them if you have additional layers then it is fine, just don't expect it to be the sole 'witness' to anything as you can't rely on it.

99,"I initially wanted to use the camera mounted to the inside of a window to observe the front walkway and door. Setup was easy. The image clarity is excellent. But the included instructions warn that camera performance will be degraded is used through a window. In my case, I was using it through double glass. I got an OK image, but the motion detection did not work. Also, battery consumption maxed out at a week. Not worth it in that particular application. But the doc gives fair warning.

But mounting the camera outside changed everything. The image was sharper and clearer, and motion detection is excellent. I even was able to back it down a bit. The battery life is at about 3 weeks. For some reason, the app on my iphone will often lag when I tap the image for a current view. Sometimes, it times-out. That isn't always reliable. It's a problem. I also have a Ring Doorbell cam that is always instantly updated. What's the deal? So, because of the application issue, I'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Perhaps an app update will be coming along at some point. By the way, it plays well with Alexa!",4,0.7538,Positive,203

101,"First of all, let me say that i am not a ring camera expert, Just a person who bought the camera and tried it.

The issues i had with this model.
1- The camera does not let me stay in live view longer than 5 to 10 minutes. Don't know if this is a app standard or user specific problem . Not a good idea on a security specific product.

2- Connecting to the camera is very hit or miss, loading time will spool up and reach an infinite loading bar at times. I am on a 5Ghz network and tried using both 2.4 and 5 options without success.

*** Edit *** The fix that worked for me was reseating my ring camera battery and turning my home router firewall security to a lower setting. Next Forward the correct ports listed for your client and ring device.

3- Cant login to Live Feed with multiple people, only will let one person view at a time.

*** Edit *** This changed after fixing settings as well.

4- The quality of the talk to camera feature is low. cant hear it very well.

The good.
1- Motion detection and recording worked fine. Once i set the sensitivity correctly, It seems to know when motion is detected
2- The quality of the picture is clear enough to see whats going on in front of the camera.

Feature recommend / request
1- Auto show camera feed when motion is detected.
2- Notify all app users when someone logs into live view (app toast notify)

102,"I have been wanting a security system for a long time, but the systems that were available were difficult to set up, unreliable, and expensive. I acquired my first Ring camera by winning it in a drawing. I was hooked right away! I ended up buying a few more.

Setup was super easy. Installation was the most difficult part. There are many features to customize to your needs.

So far, it is mostly the neighborhood cats that trigger the cameras. I knew there were some cats in the area, but I was surprised to learn how much time they spend on my property. One time a cat triggered a camera, then slinked off camera. Another cat followed it. I was calmly watching this peaceful appearing video, when vicious snarling and hissing suddenly came from nowhere, almost causing me to have a heart attack.

It's possible to set the camera to only pick up human activity, but I am leaving it set to pick up all activity. I enjoy most of the cat activity, and even caught some birds. When winter is over, I'm looking forward to seeing how often bears and deer visit my property.

These cameras are supposed to work inside while pointing outside. However, I could not get them to work. I had to install the cameras outside in order to detect motion.

Before you buy this, there are a couple of things you need to know. First, you need to make sure your internet coverage will work (something I had a problem with in the past). Also, keep in mind that you will need to pay for a subscription service in order to have access to saved videos. Without that, this will only work to have a live view of the area.",5,0.9777,Positive,295

No motion zone. Spotlight breaks the zones into 3 vertical zones, doorbell is based on distance and floodlight let’s you draw the zone. I wish they can have the floodlight motion zone for all cams. Right now it’s detecting every car that comes by and there is nothing I can do. Maybe privacy setting but ring only allows 45 degree boxes. Disappointing.",1,-0.7874,Negative,142
104,"The camera is just okay. The mounting bracket makes it impossible to angle the camera down very far so you have to mount it lower than you may want. The big thing though is in the motion sensor. Sometimes it is extremely sensitive but other times you can't get it to do anything. As a test, I pulled into the driveway within view of the camera. Got out of the vehicle, walked up to the camera, did some jumping jacks, turned around and walked away - NOTHING. Motion sensor was not triggered at all. I don't have the ""snooze"" function activated either. Good concept, poor execution.

Edit - I HATE this camera. Some days it records nothing, other days it records every car that moves in the parking lot ACROSS THE STREET even though the zones are set way lower than that. Tonight I pulled in the driveway and the camera did not notice any movement. I walked up to the camera, waved my hands in front of it, smacked it multiple times and still nothing.. I smacked it hard enough that it literally fell off the mount and down to the ground......still nothing.

I uninstalled the camera from the app, and reinstalled it. Worked for a full day and the same thing happened.

106,"So very disappointed in this products set up instructions. I have two other cameras the instructions were right on. I installed a fully charged battery, Scanned the new device into the Ring App. Then set up software asks to switch to a power source, Battery or Power Outlet. Why not both? Looks like it DOES NOT Charge the internal battery, but it does. Very poor wording in the App setup instructions. So I called, Spoke to technical service for 30min asking, ""Will this camera charge a battery in Power Outlet mode, I think it won't? She stated after much discussion it does not, admitting my suspicions are correct, it's battery or power. BUT not both. A total show stopper.... BUT!!!

Still not convinced I went on-line and found this statesmen which changed everything.
""Stick Up Cam Plug-In comes with an AC adapter that plugs into standard power outlets, and you can also purchase a Quick-Release Battery Pack (sold separately) for dual power. With the battery pack inserted, Stick Up Cam Plug-In will be powered by the adapter and will use the battery as backup.""

GREAT that is what I hoped. So the problem was a poorly educated technical gal and the wording in the app at set up. Not the actual operation of the camera. I took a battery at 50% from my Ring Door Cam and installed it to see what happens through the day. And (YEA!) it does charge ""very slowly"" from 50% to 88% in about six hours.

Be very careful not to pull power and the battery as I did thinking it had static memory, NOT! In a couple of minuets all the set up memory is lost and set up must be done all over again. DON'T loose the ""Scan Code"" you may need it for the setup process again.

All in all it's working as designed. Only reason for the 4 stars is programing is very convoluted to figure out.

What good is a security system where the camera stops working for no reason, the system doesn't tell you it isn't work and Ring doesn't know what to do or how to fix. The app shows it as online, my router shows it connected, and if you move in front of it the blue light comes on, but it will not send a notification of movement, will not record and you can't see live view.

For some unknown reason to me and Ring customer support the camera will stop working as it should. On the Ring app is shows online, my router shows it connect and when you move in front of it the blue light comes on as if it has sensed movement and recording, but it isn't. Movement does not trigger notifications, nothing records and it can't go live. This has happened three time in 1 month and there is no way to know it isn't working. How we have figured it out it isn't working is by people coming in the driveway and not getting notifications and can't access the camera on the app, online or with the Echo show. I did work with the Ring customer service for over an hour, they got frustrated because I asked what they were going to do and hung up on me.

One thing I should have done was I should have tested these cameras before installing them as now I have to uninstall them to either get a replacement or a refund.",3,0.8873,Positive,167
110,"I bought these cameras to put on the front porch and lanai out back. Setup was simple, but there was an issue with a weak wireless signal for the lanai camera. I ended up having to get a range extender to fix that, but then found this kit isn't like what Ring normally gives you. For example, the security screws are a philips screw instead of the usual ring star screw and not all the mounting hardware is included in these. Theres no ring screw driver,drill bit, or even the screws to affix the power adapter to the wall. I called Ring and they said thats what is included and tried to figure out the right mounting hardware for outdoor power brick. Without that, anyone can pull power from your camera. Ring tried to find the part and is hopefully sending them to me. These cameras are essentially the 2nd gen battery camera with a power cable. However, unlike the 2nd gen, there's no way to secure the barrel tip cable to them like the old 2nd gen battery. The Pro is the outdoor power cable combined with the plug makes a total length of 32 feet you can run your camera from and I used every inch of it on my front porch. Its a good value camera and works great. I appreciate the added advanced motion zones, but if i did it over, I would probably go with either the Ring Elite or Spotlight wired camera over these for outdoor use.",4,0.9411,Positive,253
111,"I thought it wasn’t going to be that good from the reviews I read but this camera beat my expectations, it’s clear, the night vision is awesome, you can set zones for motion detection and you get invited to see all the stuff other ring members post that live in your area. Some of it is really funny. Overall I’m extremely happy with purchase, I will most likely buy another one for the back yard",5,0.9758,Positive,75
112,I purchased a Ring number one doorbell and only having a few days I decided to buy one of the stick up cam’s. I absolutely love it. From anywhere I can open the app and turn on the camera and look and see what’s going on inside the house. I also feel much more secure because it senses and emotion and immediately alerts me within about five seconds. Very small and compact it’s about 3/4 the size of a regular soda can. And the battery seems to be very strong. I’ve had it set up for four days with probably 15 to 20 alerts a day plus getting it set up and the battery still at 96%. I also bought a back up battery. So far I’m very pleased with this product but will update you in six months.,5,0.7984,Positive,139
113,"I have a neighbor who complained about my dog barking. He doesn’t bark excessively and we stop him if he starts to bark too much. But after the neighbor called the cops we decided we needed to protect ourselves and our furry family member. This works! We set it to record for 120 seconds. And it records every time he goes out and comes back in.

Of course now that we have proof the neighbor hasn’t called the cops yet. But the picture is great! The sound isn’t amazing but it at least records his barking. Very happy customer.

We did have to pay $30 for the year of membership so we could keep the recordings but it wasn’t too bad",5,0.9385,Positive,121
114,"Set-up was fine, no problems. Left it on overnight to see how it did on it's own. After about two hours it died. Battery was good, it just shut off. No motion detection obviously. Not what I want from a security camera. Called Ring support, they're clueless. All they can do is read a drop-down menu and if that doesn't fix it then return it. They really don't care.
Update: Believe it or not but Ring representatives actually DO read reviews. I was contacted via email by a nice gentleman from Ring politely inquiring about my review and what was my problem with the device. We had a nice chat and he did offer his disappointment that their product failed me. Ring is a good product and their prices and plans are about the best out there, IMHO. He was gracious enough to offer me a discount should I care to give them another try. After my current upset subsides I probably will. I'm a magnet for glitches in the matrix and feel I did get a defective product; it happens, to me mostly. I'll purchase another Ring camera and see how that goes. I have hope. Ring is a good company; many friends and relatives have their devices so they do come highly recommended as well. Will edit review as events play out. Final word: Purchased another Stick Up Battery Cam and Chime Pro for wi-fi extender. After about a half hour on the phone with customer support - and I got excellent customer service - and a very nice lady explained how to make it all talk together. Perfect! Would certainly recommend Ring for quality products.
UPDATE: Now another update and Ring has once again failed spectacularly. Enough of this. I have spoken to Jason with Ring. A very nice and knowledgeable gentleman. I sincerely hopes he finds another occupation more akin to his qualifications because right now Amazon/Ring has him pushing crappy merch and putting out fires from customer complaints. In closing, allow me to remind you DO NOT purchase ANY Ring security products.",1,0.9956,Positive,347
115,"7/31 Update: I waited out to see how long the batteries would last after having to ch age the settings. It’s the 11th day today and the batteries have died so I’m stuck with no ring surveillance while I’m having to recharge them. If this is their way of forcing you to purchase additional batteries and waste more money. Shame on ring! Honestly save your money! Invest in something better!

7/21/2020: I purchased 3 of these cameras. After much research they just seemed the best option with the best reviews. However, now I feel pretty fooled. We’ve installed 2/3 cameras and I’ve noticed their motion detection isn’t good. I had my settings set at standard recommendation which is what is recommended to apparently conserve battery life. However, today just one day after installation I noticed these cameras will not catch important footage if someone were to break in to my home at a quick motion. I received a notification of motion when my husband entered our home and when I reviewed the image all it had caught was the door closing. It did record me right after entering behind him but it totally missed his entranced. Now I went and adjusted the motion settings to More frequent However I was instantly warned it will shorten my battery life by doing so. The whole purpose of me buying the cameras was to feel safer knowing the cameras will aid with surveillance. I did feel safe after installing them But after today’s motion detection incident I really am disappointed. I did increase the frequency to see whether that will help with the motion detection. However, I’m pretty concerned with the battery life. I tried looking up back up batteries and that’s another $30 for each camera I’d have to waste. Now I’ve already paid 120$ for each camera and it’s mounts. Not to mention I will have to pay monthly for the cloud. I’m really debating returning these cameras. At this point I wouldn’t recommend. Also I’d like to mention the camera doesn’t seem to detect shorter people at standard frequency. I’m 5’2 and it won’t detect me unless I’m with my husband who’s 5”11.",1,0.9427,Positive,363
116,"How ironic. The exact same time the ""free"" video recording ended, our units stopped showing live views when motion is sensed. When motion is sensed, we try to open the live view to see what's going on and it won't open, giving us a message of connectivity problems. However, if we wait about five minutes and then go to live view, it opens without a problem - every time. I finally gave up when we received a motion sensed at 11:30 last night and I couldn't get it to open. So this morning I tried to do the Basic Level of paid service so we could use the cameras for the very reason we wanted them, but I can't get past the credit card information. I know everything is correct but the ""review plan"" button is grayed out and I can't get past that. In the meantime, both of our cameras are useless unless we just want to watch what's going on outside 24/7 instead of only when we receive a motion notification. We could have purchased far cheaper cameras that would have worked for us better than this. We feel we are being forced into a payment plan although they are supposed to work for the purpose we want them without a payment plan. If we can't get the payment plan activated, we will be returning both cameras.",2,0.0415,Neutral,229
117,"The good:

Before the camera becomes unresponsive, it is a great camera. Video quality is decent, motion is detected reliably, and live view starts quickly.

On motion detection, it does miss the first 2-3 seconds of motion, even on AC power. For my purposes, this is fine as I have Unifi cameras in places where this would be unacceptable.

I did not test audio on the camera.

The bad:

This camera becomes unresponsive after about one day and requires re-setup every time.

I'm on camera #2 and I've yet to make it to two days of continuous operation on either camera. I always find it frozen with a solid blue light on, the app reports ""healthy"" and green even if the last health check was several hours ago, and live view fails to start.

This can't be fixed remotely, making the issue more frustrating. The camera must be factory reset, setup, and firmware updated again, which can only be done in person.

I have solid wifi coverage in my home, the camera is plugged in for power, with a charged battery installed, and it's in the same room as its access point. It's not a connectivity issue.

Recommendations:

For cloud uploaded videos, I recommend Blink. My XT2 has been 100% reliable on battery power alone. (it also accepts USB power, but I haven't tried this yet)

For locally saved, 24 hour recording, I recommend Unifi cameras. The G3 Flex and G3 Bullet have also been 100% reliable for me so far.",1,0.8049,Positive,251
118,"WOW! Highly impressed. We purchased these cameras to install outside our house for that added protection of audio and video surveillance.

The video/picture/audio quality are great! I haven't experienced any issues at all with quality! The night vision is by far the greatest I have seen in wireless cameras. The night vision has perfect clarity and no distortion at all! It works just as good at night as it does in day light.

The motion detection works really well for us. We went through the initial setup and chose the preferences that worked best for what we were wanting. You can even set zones so you don't have any unnecessary recordings or alerts!

The battery life is also really good, like crazy good, at least for us anyway. They last about 3 to 4 months. What we have done is kept a backup battery that is fully charged for each device, that way when we charge the batteries, we don't have to worry about any of our Ring Devices not working.

The Cams integrate flawlessly with Alexa as do all Ring Products. I have seen the quality of other Ring competitors and they don't stand up even close to the quality that the Ring Cameras or other Ring Products produce.

If you are looking for great quality, and a product to perform as it is intended to do, then look no further than Ring. Ring truly does live up to it's expectations!",5,0.9937,Positive,242
119,"I should have waited for the reviews to come out instead of pre-ordering but I trusted the Ring would make the new outdoor camera better than the one it was replacing. This camera has no motion zones at all. Just one that you can set the sensitivity but that seems to be a joke. I cannot get it to alert to a person walking up my driveway until they are about 25 feet away but I get notified of cars going by on the street about 60 feet away. Do not buy this camera since having motion zones is the only way to tune a camera to your specific location. Terrible, I either have to send it back or hope ring puts out an update to all zones.",2,0.8885,Positive,128
120,"The camera arrived quickly with clear instructions, it was easy to install and add to our existing Ring products. Our wide street view is excellent.
I cannot give it 5 stars yet as battery issue may be a problem. After initial charge we mounted on garage siding over a garage door. A week later my app notified me the battery was low, we hope this will not be a weekly occurrence! We took it down and put it on the USB charger than put it back up, so far so good after 3 days. I will lower rating if the camera continues to require weekly charging.
All our Ring products tend to notify us too often, no matter how I set the zones and motion detectors. I have front door set for people only and front porch motion but it still notifies when cars go by.
This may be my fault or the home builder who installed it, but the doorbell image can only be seen sideways or upside down on our phones.
The garage camera motion zone is set to alarm only on the driveway but this morning it was set off by school bus driving by.
Overall we like our Ring devices, as they have taken good photos of suspicious characters at our door, and it is easy to post to Neighbors or Facebook. The Neighbors alert is a nice feature as we are informed of incidents in our area.",4,0.9245,Positive,242

Ring stick up camera? Not so much. Battery life is awful and I have everything set to conservative as possible. Cannot even go 2 days. I have re-charged the battery, same problem. Running the latest update and it has made no difference. You also cannot set up a modified detection mode for motion, you can only reduce the sensitivity which again stinks as at night, I would like it to catch something.

Overall, totally disappointed and I would not try another.",1,-0.8399,Negative,90
122,"I wish I could give this two ratings .. one for indoor and one for outdoor. Once you get past the setup it works great as an indoor security camera. For outdoors you need too many lumens to get it to record color non-night vision. I've got a cheap Chinese $24 camera that picks up color/not night vision with the light from a solar powered LED. With this one I needed to hook up an electric light with bigger lumens and I wanted to go all battery in case the power was cut from my house. Set up can be abysmal I spent hours on the phone with tech support. The setup app does stupid things like tell you you entered your Wi-Fi password wrong when you've entered it correctly. Or it might hang up at a dialog box telling you it's connecting and your only option is to crash out of adding the device and starting over.
Other glitches to numerous to talk about here. The intended functionality is great but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I WILL say that the motion detection is really good. As you're setting up the app's voice will tell you ""Please be patient. Rome wasn't built in a day."" but I probably could have built Rome in the time it took me to work all the bugs out of setting this thing up.",3,0.9381,Positive,233

Advertised as 6-12 months life per charge.
Its been up a week and is dowwn to 67%

UPDATED 11/18/19
After working with Ring Tech. Support at Amazon, we determined that the battery life noted in the specs, 6 months to a year, was ambitious at best.
It was determined that adding a solar panel was my best bet. One I installed the panel and tweaked my settings for less sensitivity, my battery recharges to 100% by the end of each a=day and depletes only a % or two in the dark.
The new settings are sensitive enough to capture the movements important to me.
I now feel secure being away for long periods of time and that makes me happy.",5,0.979,Positive,124
124,"I downgraded my stars from 4 to 3 because I have connection issues far too often (see photo).

————————

It took forever for the battery to charge out of the package—Ring says it can take 5-10 hours and mine took 10, so don’t expect to use it quickly out of the box.

Very happy with how easy the cam was to install and set up. I mounted it above my garage for a view of my street and driveway. Clear picture and decent sound.

The connection is pretty reliable—I think the issues I sometimes have with slow connectivity or periods of no connectivity are due to my internet connection or the Ring app rather than the camera.

The problem is the short battery life, which I expected from reading the reviews but was hoping wouldn’t be this bad. The battery dropped from a full charge to 7% in a week. It logs anywhere from 19-40 motions a day. Getting the ladder out and climbing up there to change the battery each week isn’t acceptable.

I’d like to attach the Ring solar panel to avoid having to change the battery weekly; however, I’m seeing mixed reviews on whether the panel is compatible with this Stick Up cam.",3,0.6496,Positive,206

You just open the app and turn on the camera. The Ring App walks you through setup with the fewest steps. Two, the Ring Security System is the best especially when paired with Ring Home Monitoring. We have tested the Arlo Pro against our Ring Camera and the video play back from the Ring is superior. Three, works great with both Alexa and Siri.
The night vision for the Ring is great but not the best of the four different cameras we used. Arlo Pro surprised us since everything else was far behind Ring. We have owned the Drop Cameras in the past and tried the new Nest Camera. It was very disappointed by the lack true improvement over the years to keep up with the competition, damn Google for nerfing Nest.",5,0.9903,Positive,164

My first camera arrived and no problem for the first week, everything was working fine, then one morning I check for activity the previous evening and nothing but black screens. Tried resetting, reconnecting wifi, reinstalling the device, battery recharging, holding the reset button for 30 secs, all to no avail. Returned to Amazon for an even exchange. They sent me a brand new one which is even worse than the first. No recording, black screens, went through the same troubleshooting process again, the thing is dead as a door nail. My wifi signal tests very good, Alexa controlled devices in every room, etc., all my devices connect with no problem with the exception of this Outdoor Stick up Cam. I tried every possible solution multiple times including disconnecting Blue tooth and disabling Ring alarm notifications/integration.

127,"Just like the blink camera, you can walk up to 15 feet away from this. wave your arms like an idiot, and it still doesn't set off the motion detector. My friend rode his motorcycle up my driveway, and it still didn't detect him However, a car 50 feet away going at least 30 miles an hour sets it off every time. So I'm not finding it horribly effective in terms of informing me when someone is on my property. I do like the quick snapshot photos it takes, since that would be the only way I would be able to see a trespasser.

I also find the audio to be equal to that of the Blink camera. But I found the shape of this camera difficult to position. I didn't want to drill a hole in my well so I was looking for something that I could just hide in the bushes. Again here I'd vote for Blink because there are some adapters to use to attach the camera without drilling into your wall.

However, the most annoying thing about this camera is that the base slides off constantly. No matter how much I click it shut, as soon as I attempt to twist it to position the camera, the top becomes detached from the base. Or the rubber part on the bottom of the base pops off if I try to screw it in anywhere.

It also does not send snapshots to my smart watch like the Blink camera does.

Neither of these two cameras is perfect but since ring charges to store my data and blink does not, I'd give the slight edge to the blink. However, the blink does not use rechargeable batteries so I might change my mind after I have to purchase new ones.",3,0.7908,Positive,300

129,"This camera absolutely does not detect motion from 20-30 feet away as they advertise. I am literally standing in front of the camera waving at it and it’s not even turning on. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with their technical support and they were unable to solve the problem. We adjusted motion settings and frequency, etc. The best they could offer was 5-10 feet away (Which doesn’t even happen most of the time) and essentially told me it is what is. I bought 6 of these junk cameras that are completely worthless when it comes to motion detection. The only good thing about them is live view, which works well. It was very clear that they have no solution to the motion detection problem and do not care to devise a solution.",1,0.6917,Positive,134
130,"These cameras are pretty easy to setup. They do a great job detecting motion and the video is quite clear. I like the ability to be able to go back and review recorded video. They come with a 30 day trial so you can see how the feature works. I have a Ring doorbell, so I am familiar with the feature. They charge $3 per month per device to store video. This may not seem like a lot, but once you have 3 devices, you are at $90 per year. They have a plan for all devices that is $100 per year. Now you are at almost the price of an Amazon Prime membership for the ability to look back a day or two on video that your device recorded. It would be nice if there was some cheaper option to save the last 24 hours only. Maybe $30 per year for all devices.

I got these to be able to check on my animals when I am not around. I think the live view will be enough for that. I have only been testing them indoors till my habitat is ready for them outside.

Contrary to the majority of reviews, for us it was a nightmare to get proper support for the setup process Once we charged up the units and initially started the app setup, we got great video image of the area we wanted to cover. Then, in getting the app set following what seemed to be clear and simple steps, no more video image. Called support, which gave us various troubleshooting suggestions, none of which resolved the problem. After nearly an hour with support, the call dropped. She didn't call us back. So we went to google to see if there was any useful guidance. Nope, that is a dead end. It took us about 10 hours to finally get the system up and running. BTW: Our WIFI signal is strong. And yes, we did charge the units fully, which took over 10 hours.",3,0.9662,Positive,157
132,"I got a pair of cameras and mounted them in front of my garage, perhaps 25 feet from my WiFi router. Couldn't get them to connect to the router at all. I was able to put my phone near the cameras in airplane mode and then connect to the router without an issue. It even claimed to have a full three rings of signal, but I'm not sure how meaningful that is. I bought a Chime Pro repeater to help boost the signal that I originally installed about half way between the cameras and the router. That was good enough for an intermittent connection, but to get a reliable connection I had to get an extension cord and move the Chime Pro to the other side of the wall where the cameras are mounted. Now that it's only about 6 feet away from the cameras (closer than the power warts that are separated from the cameras by an 8 foot power cords, so I'm I'm sure I have the distance right) everything finally works reliably. But a WiFi range of 6 feet seems incredibly short even when that 6 feet includes an exterior wood frame wall.

The motion detection isn't remotely as nice as the Ring doorbell. The camera has three zones (left, center, right) that can be individually turned on or off, rather than the user drawn polygon of activity in the doorbell. Even with ""motion verification"" turned on, one of the cameras is constantly triggered by blowing leaves that appear in all three of the available zones. So I turned off alarms for this camera and now I get lots of nice videos of blowing leaves and the occasional car or person in that part of the driveway. Fortunately I was able to adjust the other camera so that it had a useful motion zone with many fewer leaves that only rarely trigger the camera.

After I posted the above review an agent from Ring contacted me to discuss the situation further. She asured me that an RSSI of about -60 dB is acceptable, and I don't disagree - the camera works at this signal strength. We talked about the relationship between the different components and she suggested trying other placements of the Chime Pro. After asking for permission to look at my devices she also pointed out that I have two Chime Pros and only one of them is being used as a WiFi repeater. She offered to swap the newer one (only a couple of weeks old) for a simple Chime and give me a credit for the difference. I took her up on the offer.

After the call ended, I also moved the Chime Pro to a different location. It's now further from both the access point (downstairs instead of in the next room) and the cameras (15 feet away versus 5 feet away) than it used to be, The RSSI reported by the Chime Pro is a bit worse (no surprise) but still very good. The RSSI reported by the cameras, however, improved by about 15 dB. I'm now wondering what's inside that (uninsulated) space inside the eave that separated the previous Chime Pro location and the cameras. But I'm also happy with the result.

Another update to the review. Several days ago Ring updated the firmware for plug in cameras (not battery powered cameras0 that provides the same motion zone capabilities that the Ring doorbell has. This is a big improvement over the original three zones and makes it easy to avoid motion from false triggers, such as tree leaves, that might otherwise trigger the camera. Once I pulled out a ladder so that I could reach the cameras installing the update and updating the settings to take advantage of the new capability was easy.",5,0.9949,Positive,632
133,"I love the ring stick up cams. I bought one at first just to test it out and by the second day I bought another. Easy to link into the app, install takes a minute or two, and the battery lasts a while. I’ve had mine since the 22nd of June, so about three weeks, and the battery level is at 87% still. These pick up almost too much activity which isn’t a problem for me, but for someone who has pets running around or on a busy street, this could constantly pop up with the “motion detected” too often perhaps.

Fine tuning the motion settings is fun too. You can disable certain quadrants in the zone or you can increase/decrease the sensitivity.
After a few days of playing around with it you’ll get it all to be where you want it.

Make sure you are within distance to get a good WiFi signal. If it’s far away or spotty signal you will have a difficult time viewing the live feed or retrieving video when motion is detected. A simple workaround is to purchase a WiFi EXTENDER (not booster, you don’t need faster signal you need farther signal). $20-40 for the extender and most are easy to setup.

The only downside, which isn’t a true downside, is you will notice all the animals going into your area when you didn’t realize it, or all the traffic your property might receive from people. I have my front door about ten feet from my neighbors door and these stick up cams made me realize how often they have people coming over and walking through my bushes to get to their side of the walkway...",5,0.9689,Positive,282
134,"Update 05/29/2020:

Got the new replacement cameras from Ring. However, one of the cameras they sent could not get through the setup. Called support and they could not get it to work either. At this point, there is no point continuing this. It is my view that this model of camera from Ring has serious issues and should not be on the market. Jason from support sent me return labels and I will be returning to Ring for a full refund. Good on them for giving me a full refund, but they obviously have some serious issues. Obviously my one star review will have to remain one star.

Update 05/14/2020:

Have to give kudos to Ring Support. They saw this review and I received an email and then a follow up call from Jason. We reset the cameras and re downloaded the firmware for the cameras. They both started working. However, within 24 hours, one of them went into the same non-working state. No error messages, it just stops recording and no live view. Jason is now replacing that camera. However, while waiting for this camera to ship, the other one went down. Same issue. At this point, I cannot chalk this up to a defective camera, but rather an inherent issue with the stick up camera model in general. I am waiting for a response from Jason, but at this point my intention is to ask for a full refund for the cameras and my subscriptions for both cameras. I am really disappointed. I was hoping to be able to come here and revise my review with an increase in stars, but I cannot at this point. Maybe when Jason gets back to me, there will be a positive resolution and I can revise this review again. Time will tell.

By the way, I have no issues with the Ring doorbell at this time.

If I could give negative stars I would. Every couple of days, the cameras stop working. Only way to get them working again is to take the battery out and back in.

Eventually, I put it on the solar panel so I wouldn't have to bring the battery in and charge it. The camera has a port in the back to plug in power or solar.

Does not pick up motion as quickly as the doorbells and the night vision is not real clear. The motion detection setting in the app only allows motion on the lower 2/3 of the picture. I had to play with it a lot to get the motion detection where I wanted it.

I also use the privacy feature to block out neighbors windows. The only problem is you have to make the mask quite large, so I lose some of the picture I want to see.

In general, the integration with Alexa, the Ring app, and other devices is very good. Be aware that you must take the subscription service to save videos.

In response to my original review, Jason (Executive Community Support Representative) reached out to assist us with finding a resolution to our issues. Long story short, he (and Ring) did step up BIG time to find a satisfactory solution ... in the end we were provided with a 100% refund of our purchase as requested since we had already replaced the original camera with another due to not being able to get it to work, despite trying all the measures recommended to revive it.

Thank you, Jason ... and, all the BEST to you and Ring!

Original Review (1-25-20)
Our Ring Stick Up Cam failed just a month after we began using it ... customer service simply provided ""lip service"" and did not do much to assist us. Would not reimburse us or otherwise refund our money we expended on their product. Steer clear and go with either the Amazon Cam or one from UniFi.",4,0.9742,Positive,158
138,"4/8/20 Update:
This is the final update. The firmware upgrade resolved my issues. It is working fine. So I upgraded my review to 5 stars. Here is the bulleted summary. The original review, and the previous update, appear below unedited.
* Excellent support. They reached out to me to help me when they saw my original review. Had that not happened, I would have just sent this back.
* You cannot flip the video if you mount this upside down (like hanging it below a roof overhang, for example). It must be mounted right side up. I don’t know why, as the indoor cameras can be mounted either way.
* The integration with other ring cameras in the app is excellent. The upgrades to the app that occurred recently allow one to set “modes” and enable or disarm various cameras in various situations. Handy.
* Unlike the indoor cameras, this outdoor camera has limited control over motion detection zones. You can activate three different set zones, but you cannot draw a region like you can with the indoor camera. The motion detection works fine, but I’d rather be able to activate a particular area as opposed to picking from set regions.
* The firmware upgrade was problematic, and was the source of the issues I had. I don’t know why, but with the support help I got, it updated fine and resolved my issues. If you get one of these, and when you install it tells you it needs a firmware upgrade, make sure that happens. You can ensure it does by seeing the blue light on the front flash on and off after you set it up (and the update starts). Despite repeated attempts on my end, that did not happen until I was on the phone with support. The update does take a while, so be patient. But if the blue light is not flashing, try power cycling the camera until it does.

Bottom line: recommended.

4/6/20 Update: This is an update to my previous review. This is still a work in progress, but progress has been made. I increased my rating to 3 stars, but will revise it again after I am done testing. After posting my original review (below, unchanged), a Ring support person saw it and emailed me. Which I did not expect. We arranged a call, and he helped me get the software update applied (which, for some reason, was never properly applied). This appeared to clear the issues. I had moved the camera indoors (to eliminate any network issues on my end) and tested it all weekend, and had nothing but problems. I convinced myself through that testing that the camera was defective and figured I would return it for a replacement. However, now that the software update was applied, it seems to be working fine. I moved it back to its outdoor location (which weakens the wifi signal) and am testing it now. Hopefully this solved the problem. However, kudos to the Ring support to help with this. They reached out to me and the person I spoke with was quite knowledgeable. Very helpful. I am confident at this point that, if this camera does turn out to be defective, that a replacement will work fine. Hopefully this problem is solved for good, though. I will update this further after more testing.

The original review appears below, unedited.
---
This camera (the stick up outdoor camera, powered by plug in) was completely useless. I have three other indoor ring cameras which all work fine. This one was flaky from setup. Like my other cameras, it setup easily with the app. I connected it and set it up indoors initially (the installation was to be outside). Once connected, it immediately wanted to do an update. Fine. I wait. No flashing lights, nothing. I wait and wait. After a lengthy period of time, I decided it was done. I continued through the setup and did a live view. It was very sluggish, but it worked. I figured, cool, it’s ready. So I unplugged it and went outside with an extension cord, plugged it back in, and started fooling around with location while using live view. Was working fine (however, it was here where I discovered there is no video inversion for this particular model if you want to hang it upside down - this is not true for the indoor stickup cameras, so beware of that). I leave it plugged in and sitting out side, and I return indoors to get something (I actually went inside to confirm via the internet that, yes, this camera really cannot be mounted upside down). I go back outside and try to reconnect to live view and it refuses. Claims poor connection. Complains about my phone, complains about the camera. Nothing changed. Not even the location. I had just spent several minutes up and down a ladder and screwing around with placement, all with live view. No problem. I finally decide to just remove the device and re-install it. So I do (this time depressing the button inside to put the camera in setup mode). I eventually get the same message, in the same place in the installation process, about needing an update. So I do the same thing again. This time I am doing all of this outside, because that’s where everything is now. Eventually, after (I think) the update is complete (it’s not like it tells you) I try live view. Doesn’t work. Well, it sort of worked. It worked initially, then when I tried to go back to it, it would not reconnect again complaining about a poor connection. I finally decide to try this one more time. I delete it again, move it all inside to sit right next to the wifi access point. I redo the install again (delete the device, put the camera in setup mode, re-install as before). I again get the need to update message. This time I just let it sit there for a good 20 minutes so to make sure it installed the update (or thought it did). So here I am typing this, with the camera sitting on my desk. It is in live view but constantly stops, complains about a poor connection, and so on. When I pop in and out of live view, it takes quite a while to reconnect. All of my other cameras are nearly instant. But not this one. All on the same network. The upshot? I have no idea if I just happen to have a lemon here or what, but this thing is useless. It won’t even work 4 ft from the wifi access hotspot. I can literally see it from where I am sitting. Every other device I have works fine, including other devices connected and sitting outside (an older security camera, a weather station, .... - all connected to the same network, the same wifi access hotspot). I am returning this today. Very disappointed since the other indoor ring cameras work so well.",5,0.9965,Positive,1175
139,"UPDATE 4/21/2020 : It has taken some time, but with the assistance of Ring technical support (who contacted me, I did not have to contact them), I have finally managed to get the cameras working in an acceptable manner, it just takes trial and error, and most importantly, *a good wifi signal*.

Motion detection technology itself still has room for improvement and I believe my initial expectations may have been a bit unrealistic. I did upgrade my router to a Netgear Nighthawk and that did noticeably improve my signal strength, which has resulted in more reliable and consistent recording; I strongly encourage you to test your wifi strength at the locations you have decided to mount the cameras, and if your reception is weak you should be prepared to either upgrade your router, add a mesh or repeater, or be willing to live with subpar performance from your camera.

Here are some things I discovered in the course of a few hours of tweaking various settings:
MOTION VERIFICATION - if you have this ""On"" you may end up with recordings that are ""cut off at the beginning"", for example rather than see a car pull into your driveway, driver get out, and walk to the house, you may only see the edge of the guy's shoulder move out of the picture and then a view of his car sitting there in the driveway. On the other hand, having this ""Off"" may cause trivial notifications, such as headlights passing by, insects flying in front of the camera, etc... I ended up with one camera having this turned off and the other two having it turned on to get the results I wanted.
MOTION SENSITIVITY - Don't let the dramatic THIS IS GOING TO RUIN YOUR BATTERY LIFE! warning scare you, I had to set the motion sensitivity to about 70% to get my Side camera to pick up motion near the edge of the range, my other cameras were fine at around 30%. One way to think of this is, if you want to capture motion out towards the edge of the range of the camera, like a back yard, you should turn up the sensitivity; if you are using your camera to cover a smaller area like a back porch, a lower sensitivity will be fine.

Be prepared for the batteries to not last ""months"", one of mine already needs to be recharged and the other two probably will by the end of May. But given the limits of current battery technology that's really not bad, I'm fine with it... just keep accessibility in mind when you mount these things because you will need to pull the batteries every 4-12 weeks and recharge them. I may pick up a spare battery.
******************************************************************************

I am very frustrated with these cameras so far. The only reason I haven't returned them (yet) is because there doesn't seem to be much of an alternative when it comes to battery powered cameras. I have spent way too much time tweaking the motion detection settings and the cameras are still doing stupid things like sending an alert when a tiny moth flies in front of the camera but doesn't detect when one of our kids gets into his car and pulls out of the driveway. If it's not going to detect someone getting into a car and driving off then so much for it being of any use as a security camera. I've relocated one of them once and the other one twice and it hasn't helped. I still get notifications and play back the video and see absolutely nothing happening, or they miss events that definitely should have been captured, I can see it being too sensitive or not sensitive enough, but how can it be wrong both ways?! It's like they are doing the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do, capturing what should be ignored and vice versa. And they're both doing it! On top of that, despite claims of battery life lasting for ""weeks or months*, one camera is already down to 77% after being in use for only 6 days; the other is at 97%.

If I can't get better results from these things by near the end of my 30 days, I'm sending them back. I will update with the final verdict... but I've all but given up.",4,0.9871,Positive,730
140,"These are really just terrible. I bought 2 of them(one wired, one wireless) and they're useless. First, the app crashes ALL the time, I've never seen an app this bad. For security purposes, when you get a motion notification you need to be able to connect to the camera and investigate. Yet when you open the app it crashes literally 50% of the time so you miss the event. Ok, but at least it records the event, right? No, what they don't tell you up front is that the camera only records for like 20-30 seconds after motion is detected, even if the motion is still happening. So it'll record the potential intruder approaching, but then it stops recording before they actually do anything. Completely useless, especially because even the corded version doesn't record long either, so battery life is no excuse for this limitation. I assume it's so they can save costs on storing videos on their servers?

But wait, there's more. You get a free trial where the recorded videos are saved on their servers so you can access them. When this trial expires the cameras no longer record videos unless you buy a subscription which is cheap, but even without the subscription you can still get motion alerts and connect to your cameras and see a live picture of what's going on(if the app doesn't crash, which it will). The kicker here is that as soon as my free trial expired, I could no longer to connect to live view either. Every time I try, it tries to load for a second then says ""Live View Ended"". Once in a while it actually connects. And it's not a wifi signal issue either, the device says the wifi strength is plenty strong, and this only became an issue directly after my free trial expired, so just seems like an attempt to get people to purchase the subscription by making the product totally unusable without it.

Update: I've tried reinstalling one of the cameras from scratch, including a reinstall of the app. Nothing has changed. Then today the other camera's motion zones have stopped functioning. So it's capturing motion even in areas I tell it not to. The area I've told it not to capture motion is a plant blowing in the wind, and even on lower sensitivity settings it triggers the motion sensor all the time. So, 100% unusable now. Just a terrible product.",1,0.9522,Positive,406
141,"I hope you don't fall for all the 3 and 4 star ratings.

This camera only records for 20 seconds! No matter what is going on, it will not record for more than 20 seconds after being activated.

There is nothing you can do about this. This is true even for hardwired powered Ring cameras. It has nothing to do with battery life, but they lie to you and say it does.

It also limits the number of recordings in a 15 minute period you are allowed.

I did not find all this out until I called their helpline to ask why my camera was not working correctly. It turns out it is working correctly, just not the way any reasonable person would expect it to.

This company is totally on the cheap. They do not want to devote the server space to provide a quality experience which allows you to actually record video.

The support for this product is also horrible. Their online chat says they do not help with install or troubleshooting. WHAT ELSE IS HELP CHAT FOR?

Their online help would not accept my password, even though I double and triple checked it on my app. So then I decided to click the Reset Password link and it never sent an email to reset my password.

This is basically no better than a cheap camera which only allow you to see a live stream.

I have not received one since I waived my hand in front of it while setting it up. This is setup looking out my back window and a high traffic area for my family and it has not captured one thing since it’s been installed.

143,"Extremely helpful info below if you already have a Ring doorbell or other camera!

I have used Swann video surveillance for over 3 years and it hasn't been great. It failed to record when my office was broken into. Great timing. Anyway, this was my reasoning for trying something new.

I cannot express enough how extraordinarily simple this was to set up. You won't need the video instructions, but if you do, each step has its own video. This camera, including mounting it, mounting and attaching the optional solar cell, and complete set-up took under 20 minutes. The pairing and set-up was around 3-4 minutes and the hardest part was remembering my Wi-Fi password.

Two very important things to note:

1. If you're using this with an Echo Show, and you already have another camera or doorbell set up, and you then install this and can't get it to show on your Echo, I have found the solution that I could not find anywhere. Simply go into your Alexa App, go to ""skills"" and and disable the Ring skill. Then enable the Ring skill again and it will discover the new camera and work instantly.

2. If you plan to mount this camera to a wall, pole or any other vertical surface, you will need to purchase the optional wall mount. They are $8 ea. or $14 for a pair right here on Amazon.",5,0.7336,Positive,234
144,"Update: My camera was only doing 20 second snips. I actually talked to an Amazon tech to ask for help. He spent a good amount of time, but ended by telling me 20 seconds was normal! This morning the app informed me I had a plug in model and did I want to activate the better video options available for the plug in model. It prompted me to put the camera in start up mode (pushed button inside battery compartment). I went thru the guided set up, including much more detailed motion zones. Camera also lengthened video from 20 seconds to a full minute!!! Yay!!!😀😀😀

I am very pleased with this cameras performance overall. I have 2 other Ring cameras and they work well together. I have mine all linked for extra security. My only disappointments was long lag times to access LIVE video sometimes. Rapid Ring app seems to have solved this problem. It is a very basic app that you can use as a supplement to the original app. It has only 2 functions live video access FAST and it can send notifications. You will probably want to disable the notification feature as they are basic and cannot compare to the original app custom notifications. You must disable the notification in the Rapid Ring app or it will disable your custom notification in the original app. Rapid Ring is available for Fire tablet too 😂!!! Bigger Pic and no drain on my phone battery!!!",5,0.9857,Positive,246
145,"The camera is working fine so far. I have the ring doorbell. I can monitor the doorbell on my laptop but when I installed the outdoor camera, it showed up on my phone but I can not monitor it on my laptop. Ring support says they are working on the issue but I don't believe them. Time will tell. They don't seem to care that people use these devices at home and laptop monitoring is a much simpler way to monitor and control your devices when you are at home. I know the two devices are linked to my account because every time I go to the app on my laptop the 30 day free subscription countdown is shown at the bottom of the screen. I know this is a review for the camera but it all is part of a complete system if you don't have the option of monitoring on a laptop and a phone then I guess I will have to look elsewhere for a camera that can be monitored on a laptop. This shouldn't even have to be an issue in this computer age, but it is.

Update: Ring support contacted me. They corrected the windows app for viewing my camera on my laptop. I will raise my rating two stars. The customer service was very quick and responsive. Only reason for not giving the camera 5 stars is there are still minor bugs in the camera. Picture quality is grainy. It could be my internet connection but the ring doorbells picture (connected to the same network and about the same distance from my router) is much better.",4,0.9377,Positive,272
146,The 2 stars are because the WiFi signal is great and day time visual is great. Cons even after changing multiple settings and modes batteries last only about 5 days. After the first week I stopped getting alerts. Motion sensors for people are almost non existent. Had to reset multiple times. Not good for outdoor use not weather resistant the night pictures and just condensation from cold temperatures no rain therefore on cold nights cannot see anything whatsoever. From about 9pm until 8am can’t see anything. Day time visuals and evening before cold temperatures clear imaging but again alerts and person detection stopped after about a week. Will be returning as I needed this primarily to get alerts when packages are delivered during the day and I would need to reboot all week to get the alerts and to watch my house at night which will not work because it’s cold and impacts the camera. No alerts and no visual at night is not worth the Money plus having to remove the camera to reboot and having to recharge batteries frequently. Basically only good to see cars drive by during the day during the day lol not what I wanted.,2,0.4114,Positive,200
147,"Great cameras.
PROS- The line of site is great. The quality of the picture/video is very good. You have to play around with the settings to get the correct angle, motion detection and proper notification as with any camera. Overall the function of a security camera is perfect. I also like that you can link your cameras to eachother that if one detects motion the rest will begin recording before motion is sensed to get a full range video of the perimeter of your home.

CONS- My major problem is the battery life. When I installed I purposely used one with a solar panel and one without to see the battery life and there is a major battery issue.. The one with a solar panel looses 2-5% of life throughout the evening and is recharged during the day with the solar panel. Which depending on the sun I usually have 100% full battery until sundown.
The one without the solar panel connected looses approximately 5-10% of battery life a day on a standard motion detection which is the medium battery usage selection. With that much energy used means the battery, clearly will not last more than a month before it will need to be recharged, which is an inconvenience to have to bring the ladder out every month to change the battery. Diffenantly would recommend getting the solar panels for continuous battery life.

Overall these camera are perfect for home security. I would recommend",4,0.9828,Positive,244
148,"I have the Ring alarm system. This is the first camera I've added.

Overall, I'm impressed based on the week+ that I've used it to monitor my front yard/porch. Image quality is great and it seamlessly integrates with the Echo Show family of products. I have not experienced issues with motion detection -- it has been consistent, day or night. It was a matter of finding the ""sweet spot"" that provided good coverage but not so much that cars/street traffic were triggering the detection. I also like the fact that there is an option to have the camera powered by plug plus battery for backup.

On the downside, once motion has been detected, video clips tend to not be ready for review for a minute or two afterwards. I don't find it to be a huge deal breaker since a live feed shows within five seconds of being requested - the recorded clip can be reviewed later.

I look forward to deeper integration with Ring Alarm - namely motion detection being turned on automatically if alarm is set to away mode. I'd also like to see the ability to have detection automatically turn on at sunset and deactivate at sunrise.

149,"I've installed this at my place of employment, 3 of them now and we love them! I've caught attempts at theft, a blatant theft and seen a decrease in things ""walking off"". The Ring app is absolutely necessary to integrate every Ring device in you home/business. Another review states there was no way to integrate a previously installed doorbell alarm when, yes there is. It's not the easiest thing to figure out though, tbh. YOU MUST HAVE THE RING APP!!! You can download a version for desktop from the Windows store but it will not work for initial set up/install and lacks many of the feature/menu options the app has. App navigation is also not simple, a guide will show certain aspects, while others you have to search for and figure out yourself which leaves the ""system"" feeling a little incomplete. A section showing what's new also highlights new products so you get tired of the sales pitches and end up missing actual changes to the app. Overall for the money, it's totally worth it!

I was looking at going with Nest but they are just crazy expensive, $200 or more per camera?!?! I had four cameras total and that was still $40 cheaper than just one Nest cam. But, you do get what you pay for. Those took forever to connect on the app, their desktop app didn't even work at all and were powered by USB ( at least the ones inside) which made me have to use an extension cable and have ugly cables going everywhere. I thought I'd give these cameras a try since they were battery powered. I was a little concerned since they weren't recording 24/7 but after actually using them, it's not that big of a deal. The motion detection works pretty good and the fact that you can view live video almost instantly is great (the cheapo cameras took FOREVER to connect). Plus, the video quality and field of view is fantastic. I'm sure the more expensive cameras probably have a better field of view but honestly, these are great for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this camera if you're looking for the middle ground camera (better than the cheap Chinese cameras but not as expensive as those $250+ cameras), also has the benefit of being wireless.

153,"I live out in the country. I purchased this camera to be able to see my back door/back porch, mainly for night time or when I'm away from the house.

The ""evolution"" of this purchase:
1. Purchased the camera ($100).
2. After reading more reviews about poor battery life, I purchased the Ring solar panel charger, also (another $50).
3. After getting poor wi-fi connection at multiple locations that I tried on the back porch, a few days later I purchased the Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender, too (yet another $50).

Performance of the camera/solar panel/Chime Pro combo:
Camera did not work reliably without the Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender. Performance is much improved connecting via the Ring Chime Pro. The solar panel - even though it is in the shade for about half the day - has no problem keeping the camera battery fully charged (consistently at 99-100% battery charge).

The good:
Convenience and easy installation of being wireless;
Great quality video;
Excellent night vision also;
Solar charger works well;
Ring Chime Pro works well as wi-fi range extender

The not so good:
Had to purchase the wi-fi extender for this camera to get close to being reliable, even though other wi-fi devices worked just fine at those locations where I have the camera installed;
Camera motion triggering not very sensitive and has only very limited adjustment (no ""zone"" setup like other Ring devices). I have to walk within 10 feet of the camera for it to trigger on my movement;
LiveView is still only about 50% operational, even with a confirmed strong and fast wi-fi signal at that location - sometimes it will show live view, sometimes it will not.
Ring Chime Pro wi-fi extender does work well (after having to be on the phone to the help desk for almost an hour to get it to work initially) , but it is very sensitive to its own location - moving it just a short distance from one electrical outlet to another only a few feet away made a huge difference in performance. Because of that, it ended up having to be in a less than desirable location in the house in order to function properly.
Software seems pretty clunkly overall. It has a calendar function so you can enable/disable motion alerts, but only one on/off cycle per day. So I end up having to remember to manually turn alerts on and off so I'm not getting constant alerts when I'm at home and walking directly under the device. Plus, it can take up to a minute to show either LiveVIew (when that works at all) or a recent recording. I imagine that time would seem much longer when you hear that ""bump in the middle of the night.""
Oh, and the $3 monthly minimum charge to Ring to be able to see your recorded video. No way to save your own video recording without the subscription.

Overall, I'm pretty unimpressed. The two main functions I was looking for are unreliable; It won't detect motion at my back door from about 18 feet away, and LiveView operation only works sometimes.

Problems with this generation is that it only works with 2.4 WiFi and there is no adjustment for the motion area like I have on the door bell. ( The little handles you can grab to select the exact motion area). I have a Ring alarm system with the ring doorbell and was trying to keep it all the same. I purchased a wired stick up camera. Now even with a WiFi extender the camera response is crap. I get alarms every time a car goes by because I cant adjust the alert area and when I do get an alert, it takes me a minute for the video to process. To connect the lights with the rest of the ring system, you have to buy a bridge. I think they are terrible software designers who can't figure out how to integrate their components to work together so they make the consumer buy extra crap to make it all work. Now they introduce products and take features away on subsequent generations. Normally new generations of products are better than the previous generation. With Ring they seem to be worse. Bridge for the lights to work with the cameras, WiFi extender Chime for the cameral to conect because the receiver in the camera is soo bad. I am stuck with the Alarm but this terrible camera is going back!!!!",2,-0.951,Negative,252
160,"After 3 months of use I would give this product 3/5 stars. The camera overall is a great value but there are some shortcomings.
First it's strengths is that is provided a decent picture rated at 1080p especially during daylight. I had no problem connecting to WiFi currently using a nest wifi router. If you have a ring doorbell and Amazon show; product intergration is good. Alexa can show video feeds in about 5 seconds average for me. Ring app is good and neighbor app is ok.

The biggest complaint for me is that the motion detection is not great. Its range is some what limited and inconsistent. Maybe 10-15 feet. Fast moving objects like the guy who broke and ran through my backyard to dodge the cops chasing him did not get detected. Zone detection not good u can pick 3 zones and can't customize it. Not great if you have a tree or moving objects near your camera.

Overall it's just ok",3,0.449,Positive,164
161,"UPDATE:
Constant recurring issues. All of the sudden alert tones are not working. None of the door, motion or cam tones are sounding, even though all settings are accurate. I've reset and rebooted base station multiple times. Still No alerts frm base station or my phone.
Also, tried 2 new batteries on 2 different cams, still they keep saying BATTERY LOW loud enough new neighbors to hear, even when at 100%

Customer service emailed me for my prior issues, they were very nice and professional, but now their are even more problems afterwards. And i don't have the time or patience to keep emailing and calling back and forth every other week for new problems that keep arising, to spend an hour on the phone trying to fix.

--------------------------------------------------
The motion detection only covers about half the screen range, very small amount of coverage, should offer option to cover Entire screen. Their is privacy zones, but theirs very little use for it, with such a small amount of motion sensor coverage.

The night vision only works depending on the angle. When i direct the cam a certain angle it only shows darkness, but if i readjust it a certain way it'll show pretty well.
Overall, pretty decent system. i will be keeping for convenience, since i already have 2 cams, and all other setup equipment. Their are some problems i wish would be fixed, but it pretty much serves purpose for now.",2,0.9252,Positive,242

163,"Rant
I have a ring alarm system, the doorbell and cameras. Ring’s attempt at this camera was to create an affordable and convenient way for us to feel secure. That’s all. You install it, and you feel secure however, do not count on this camera to ever allow you to go to live mode or expect it to pick up any motion.

I replaced the first camera because it would never connect to live mode. The replacement sometimes lets me see live. Sometimes, doesn’t cut it and I need it to pick up motion correctly. I happen to have same issue with my ring doorbell, but after setting it up for - 3rd time it works! I don’t have time to keep troubleshooting devices.

WiFi Signal
I have a WiFi mesh system that all these ring devices are connected to. My WiFi connectivity is no problem because I have some random brand outdoor camera that connects just fine.

Motion Detection
Just for fun I placed this camera on my kitchen counter for 3 days, it detected no movement. Trust me we’re using the kitchen. If it’s not working indoors right next to my router how can I trust this outside?

Night vision
If it detected then I would be able to know. The one time it detected something, the picture was clear compared to its competitors.

Why the two stars?
The quality is durable. It feels solid.
Easy set-up
When working the picture is clear

This has potential, if you don’t get a dud or like troubleshooting this can work.",2,0.9782,Positive,260
164,"Amazed at the quality of the image and sound feedback on this. I bought 2 of them. Definitely purchase the wifi extender though. One of the cameras has a struggle with wifi range sometimes but it's having to go through brick. That cam is actually the closest in range to our wifi. There's no way to remove blockages or move it closer either but I haven't had many signal drops on it. The one feature I wish it did have is fish eye view or more of a wider view to cover a bigger area. The sirens on these are not very loud, so don't expect that to really alert the neighborhood or draw attention to suspected creepers on your property. These cams link to a ring doorbell, which is pretty cool. So when someone drives up in the driveway, the ring door bell starts recording before they walk up. You can unlink the devices though. The battery life is what I expect them to be. I recharge these batteries once every 2 weeks probably can go 3 weeks. And that's with the dogs playing outside setting them off every 30 seconds sometimes. lol. You just have to work with the motion detection to custom it to your household activity level. The motion detection is not a far distance, about 30 feet. No big storms lately, so no idea how well it hold up. But they have experienced a few downpours. I was surprised at the viewing of night vision. Maybe it's because our outdoor light stays on in the driveway, but it's brighter than the Ring 2 doorbell.",5,0.9601,Positive,269
165,"UPDATE: After posting this review with 2 stars I received an email and a phone call from a Ring rep who wanted to help me with my issues. I am techno ignorant and he walked me through increasing the frequency of the recording so it will record more of the motion. With all the ""social distancing"" and ""self isolation"" we have at the moment nothing has crossed the path of our cameras except a deer and a squirrel so I can't say yet how the adjustment has worked out, but I am increasing my stars to 3 based on the responsiveness of Customer Service. I'll update again later when we all come out of our caves.
We purchased 7 of these cameras at $100/each giving us coverage all around the outside of the house. They were easy to set up etc, the picture/video quality is good BUT once each camera detects motion it records for 30 seconds only. It certainly doesn't show the beginning to end motion activity. So, when our local burglar approaches our house we only see 30 seconds of his treachery, instead of it recording until the motion stops. When I posted this issue on line I found people who said to change the motion frequency to ""frequent""and then the time would increase somewhat (another 30 seconds?) but I can't find any such setting. That is insufficient anyway. It needs to record until the motion stops. We were going to buy a couple more and perhaps later an alarm system, but won't throw good money after bad and will find another product.",3,0.3697,Positive,265
166,"Completely disappointed with Amazon on this one..

Update to my last post, when I received a reeboxed broken cam
. I was contacted by a member from The Ring team after I returned my stick up cam he then helped me set up the other cameras I had in home and sent me another stick up camera in two days.
I was pleasantly surprised as I was not expecting any deliveries today I have not yet taken it out of the box but I just wanted to leave a review on how well the ring team treated my situation when I never even contacted them. They reached out to me and as a caretaker I thank them for it.
I would not worry about purchasing any ring cameras because if there are any issues the ring team would be more than happy to help. I'm very impressed.
The people from ring are very nice patient and I am completely satisfied how they treated me........ I give five stars just for how ring reached out to me,took care of the situation and then some. I haven't open the box but I'm sure the camera will work.",5,0.9911,Positive,195
167,"So I have had the ring doorbell for sometime now and love it. It’s not hardwired so I do have to recharge it every now and then but it will go a month or two before it needs to be charged again. I decided I wanted a camera in my backyard and I searched for something that could be used that doesn’t have to be hard wired as well. So of course I turned to Ring again since the doorbell is so amazing. I wanted to use only one app system too so that’s another reason why I got the ring stick up cam so everything is under the same app and easy to use. One thing I would HIGHLY recommend if you are not hard wiring this product to get the solar charger for this. I did not and I wish I did. I bought the camera first just to see how long one battery charge would last. It was only a week IF that. And I have it on the lowest alert possible so it doesn’t go off all day long. The set up and the placement is very simply straight forward and easy. The battery though takes HOURS almost a whole day to charge! So, that led me to buying another battery. So when one is in there is another fully charged on deck to use when needed which has been once a week. It’s easy to change them out but it’s really annoying that I have to do often. I wish I would have gotten the solar charger because it was only 20$ more than the extra battery. Overall I would still buy this product again knowing what I do now but id get the solar charger. It’s a nice product it’s reliable and I just like the ring brand.",3,0.9855,Positive,304
168,"What a disappointment. The setup is so painful, I almost gave up before finishing it. I've been using Blink for 2 years and never appreciated how easy its setup was until now. Ring asked me for pretty much all the permissions before setting up the camera. I tried multiple times for it to connect to wifi. Finally it did, then went into an ""update"" mode for about 15 minutes. At this point I had spent 40+ minutes setting up a single camera. Then I wanted to live view, but the ""Activating Device..."" spinner never disappears. After almost an hour, I still don't have the camera working.",1,-0.3444,Negative,106
169,"The picture quality is good, the motion detection is good, setup was easy. The biggest issue I have had with this camera and the ring doorbell is you need an exceptionally strong wifi signal for these things to work. Forget it if you have guests at the house and other devices are being used that are connected to the wifi. I have the best wifi you can buy for a residential home. Initially it was hit and miss whether or not this camera or my ring doorbell would work with live connect. Motion detection worked fine, but if I wanted to use live view, it would only connect 50% of the time at best. I don't have a large house and the units were not more than 20 feet from my wifi modem/router. Granted there are walls between, but the distance was not far. To get these things to work consistently on live view I had to move mi wifi pods closer to both devices and now they work for live view most of the time. Just beware they are not just setup and use if you plan on using the live view feature to monitor your surroundings. The picture quality is much better than my old 720P wired cameras. I just wish they didn't need a super strong wifi signal to work. Also, it takes a few seconds for them to activate so a lot of the time you don't get the initial video of the person walking by.

Returned the first one, on the advice of Ring Customer Support. Got another one, same thing happened. They could not help me make it work. Charged up, allowed time for it to update, it never worked. Then I returned it, (got a brief extension because I had to evacuate wild fires) they only gave me back $65 of the $99 I paid for it! But the website says I got $88. the other money was supposed to be in Rewards Points that never arrived!

Noise. When in live mode with the sound on, I tend to hear a lot of static. However when playing back the video it sounds normal. That's fine.

Video quality: It freezes frequently. My wifi signal is ""very good"" where I keep my cameras. The image also pixelates at times. I'm using my camera to watch wildlife and see what kind of critters are hanging around my house so that's fine. People using this for security measures might find that problematic.

Battery: Expect about 9-10 hours of charge time for roughly the same amount of activity. Purchase a second battery if possible.

Switching Wifi connections. It's not as simple as switching to another wifi from an android or PC. It takes a few minutes.

That being said, it's a handy little thing to have. The app has a lot of options as to how the camera operates. The price to keep the service running is dirt cheap. $3 a camera or $10 a month is very affordable.",4,0.3119,Positive,175

The only way to save video is thru the subscription but for $10 (3+ cams) it includes a lot of other valuable addons. The battery lasts weeks or longer. I didn’t feel the solar panel was necessary; I will recharge the pack once a month or so. If you really need wireless, by the time you find another solar / battery cam that actually works and you set up storage, etc, you will have spent more than this. If this is for your parents, no question, it’s the best for normal users. Also, use the ring.com store if you’re a veteran, student or teacher for 20% off.",5,0.8641,Positive,120

However that process is glitch filled and you need extreme patience and a lot of free time to reinstall. The time it takes in each step of installation is mind-numbing. It literally took me an hour and a half to reinstall this camera. And I'm the guy who has networked my house, I've run a booster for my cell phone and I built the two computers and the backup server in my house.

Even picking up the camera and moving it around produces no motion alert.
It’s interesting that ring has also cut corners with the camera itself. The case feels much cheaper with worse fit and finish when compared to earlier examples of this version of the camera. The mount is also cheaper and less effective, not nearly as stable as the old version. The old version of the mount is available, it runs about $20. Ring even stopped including a screwdriver.

I have six other ring hardwired (POE) and doorbell in service with zero such issues. All are connected to the same access point or data switch. Internet/network bandwidth/throughput is excellent. I suspect the issue is battery operation mode or specifically the Battery cam. Unfortunately, I have to lowest rate this cam since it can't be used reliably for the purpose of security.

I’m frustrated that this product somehow won’t detect people walking directly in front of it but the slightest wind movement sets it off. I’m going to try the wired spotlight cam to see if it’s somehow better, although right now I expect the same results.

Original:
I’ve had my camera for close to a week now and so far I am unimpressed. All day long it’s alerting me about motion, from the shadow of the trees blowing in the wind, but half the time (or more) it doesn’t detect cars coming in or out of the driveway or people walking by. I’ve tried to adjust all motion settings in different ways and it’s not helping. I don’t need to know about the trees blowing in the wind but I do need to know if someone is on my property, otherwise what good is the camera?! Not only that, but the connection to the WiFi isn’t that great, even though there is a WiFi extender in the house less than 20 feet from where the camera is mounted outside. I’m considering returning it.",2,0.7691,Positive,215

I was not able to get the cameras to connect so, I bought an internet extension, still nothing. I gave a spot light and two cameras to my sister and I was going to return the other three devices. Then I received an email from a representative from Ring named Jess she was wonderful she was able to contact me at the date and time I would be available. Jess helped my sister with the minor issues she had and Jess will be assisting me with my issues with the devices I have not yet returned as well. I will provide another update in a few weeks",2,0.6728,Positive,142

I took the footage to police and his family posted on ring area alerts. I would recommend these to anyone needing a way to keep tabs on area. It also works amazingly as a baby monitor.

The older models came with two different cords, one for an inside mount and one of outside. They also had a screw driver and clips for proper installation. The new model doesn't have these items. I guess they are trying to sell more cameras for a cheaper price and let the buyer purchase the other items as additional costs.",2,-0.128,Negative,108
195,"This product worked well for 2 months, but then suddenly it went haywire. I have two cameras, each with a different alert sound. Almost every morning at precisely 8:05 a.m. the Ring app on my cell phone blurts out a cacophony of alert sounds in rapid succession. Between 15 and 50 alerts from both cameras sound off over the span of 20-60 seconds. All without any motion. At first I thought it had to do with my phone's Do Not Disturb featured, which silences notifications overnight. But if that was the case, my app would have a corresponding video for every chime occurrence, but there are no videos. I made Ring an exception to my Do Not Disturb list so that notifications would come in while I slept, but that did not solve the problem. I get zero notifications overnight, but a concert every morning still.

I contacted Support and they had no answers. They recommended snoozing Ring overnight. Well, that kinda defeats the purpose. If someone's at my door at 2 a.m. I kinda want a video recording.

Replacing the battery with a newly charged one has presented problems: .I have had to hold down the orange reset button for 30 seconds to get it to work again, and on one occasion had to perform the following trouble shooting steps (as described on the Ring troubleshooting website) to get it reconnected to Wi-Fi. So, at this point, I have found the battery changing chore to be an annoyance. But I would buy the device again.
Troubleshooting Steps to reconnect to Wi-Fi after changing battery:

I was a little surprised to find out that the stick up (wired) model could still fit a battery, despite no battery included in the package. The camera worked for a little over an hour, when I got a notification saying that the battery was critically low. This would be an ok notification if I had a battery, but I don’t! I had the same issue with the other camera, it worked for less than 2 minutes before it started saying that the battery was critically low and shutting off. I am really disappointed. I tried resetting and adding them again to my account multiple times to no avail. I found out online that it could be a firmware issue. There is no way to control what firmware you have on your camera unfortunately. I do not recommend this model at this point. Go for the cheaper and less complicated indoor cameras.",1,-0.928,Negative,182

Per Ring’s FAQs and multiple other sources claimed the image can be rotated if placed as a ceiling mount. I already have an indoor cam that I placed on a ceiling in my baby’s room and it works great. And although the image quality and all other aspects are great for all these cameras, I am really upset that the stick up cams cannot invert the image. There is no option in the app for inverting for these on the stick up cams. So please beware if you were planning on installing such as I have. I found that you have to buy a separate mount to install it upright on a wall, which is not what I want. Now I will have look into other options for outdoor cameras that can be mounted under my soffit and uninstall these!
I just can’t believe that Ring has the technical savvy to create video/image inversion on their cheap indoor cameras but cannot figure out how to enable the same ability on their new high tech outdoor cameras... baffling.",1,0.8565,Positive,196

Second it does not have the ""Rotate Video"" ability other cameras have so if you mount it on the eves upside down you need to order another part mount that allows you to turn the camera right side up. On other cameras you can just use the ""Rotate Video"" function in the app. Now I have to return this thing and waste a bunch of time what a joke.

204,"The product itself is very cool - pretty easy to install and has cool features and picture quality.

Unfortunately, in my home which is brick, the cams fall off the WiFi network (which uses a high-end mesh router), and when that happens the purpose of the product is defeated. When the network is not connected, you cannot access the live camera view and the motion detection is not reporting back to my phone. Even though the cams are fully powered and will sometimes later get re-connected, any events that took place during the network disconnect will not get reported later when the device is back online... I've tested by walking through the middle of the view.

I have reset my own WiFi connection several times (before and after install) and tested WiFi connection speed, using other devices from the same location the cams are mounted.

Without consistent connectivity, the only security that's being provided by the cams is the deterrence factor for potential thieves seeing the cameras... which is about the same as what the Ring sign (sold separately) does.

Also of note, it's annoying that you have to buy a wired connection separately.",2,0.2862,Positive,194

For as much as 1 camera costs it should be working better then what it does. I am not satisfied and plan on returning the product for poor performance. I would not buy.

206,"I'm on my fourth of these cameras for use around my home. I've been able to cover all my major access points and a few blind spots around the property. I'd read mixed results on the battery life of this model. My results have been highly dependent on the placement. Those with less traffic like the garage and basement entries have lasted 3+ months on a single charge. Having dogs that like to spend time on the deck, it lasts about 2 months on a charge. The app makes it very easy to monitor these levels and the reminders help plan when it needs a charge. I found it best to buy an extra battery and keep it charged as it then just requires a swap out and not two trips up the ladder. The wi-fi connection to the cameras seems to improve the longer it is installed (I assume it has to do with finding the best connection point) and regularly connects to the same access point. The speed to access is my only complaint as it can sometimes take a while to access the camera or a stored video once you get a motion notification. I'm sure this conserves battery life but when trying to see if I need to run to answer the door or if it is just someone dropping off a package the delay can get frustrating.

I contacted support about this issue as well as they had changed initial support agreement in just the last year.

In addition, the mount that comes with the camera has extremely limited movement/positioning, which limits the ability to focus the camera view on the desired area. Also, recording length is not adjustable.

That being said, it gets three stars because of the WiFi. Only having a 2.4ghz radio is a clear problem in a dense, urban, apartment setting. That band is essentially useless nowadays. Video is choppy and the preview frequently gets stuck for a day, despite having excellent signal.

However, this was impacting my phone, iPad, and computer were all unable to view live footage and the camera would not light up when motion was detected.

I personally wanted to use this behind a window so it pointed outside. Since I live in an apartment, damaging the siding is a no no. At first, the sensor would not work at all. I've tried everything. I finally got to the last option of purchasing the plug to make it go from cordless to wired into an outlit. And by God that did the trick. The sensor catches everything now behind the window, and fast! I guess battery only made the sensor weak? Not sure, but it works fantastic now.

When it came out and announced, I was ready for another Ring Cam for outdoor use and wanted the newer product. Bad decision in my part and should have paid more attention to the hardware reviews.

First, this product has reduced specifications versus the 2nd Generation. I get it, Ring wanted a product with a lower price point to obtain more market adoption. You just are not getting a good return for your purchase. The video quality is terrible versus the second generation product.

Second, “Live View” is horrible. If you go into the Ring App and hit “Live View”, most often, the App just spins and spins saying ""Activating Device"". Yet, most of the time, it never connects and the visitor or thief is long gone. This is not a WiFi network issue. The RSSI signal strength is good. Very good. This frustrating behavior is even exhibited when putting the Ring Cam right next To the WiFi access point.

Third, this product sounds good as the price point is lower than the 2nd generation. Great, but not so great. Today I went to mount on the ceiling only to find out the video is inverted and cannot be flipped on this camera in the software. You have got to be kidding me. What a joke. A call into Ring Tech Support I find our that you have to purchase an additional ceiling mount kit for $19 dollars. Well, there goes your savings. The 2nd generation had all this hardware right inside the box with the camera. This is a cheesy shake down by Ring.

To make matters worse, one of them activates when I tell it. The other requires me to set up the zones and sensitivity EVERY TIME, regardless of how many times I have hit ""Save"".

After 30 days, there's FEE, a subscription that makes the item operational again. The fee is/was glossed over in the ""fine print""! They'll put the sales pitch n you: ""it's on'y $3 per month!"" OK Bunky, that's $36 per year IF THEY DON""T RAISE THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE!! Oh sure, Amazon offered a refund but who's going to fill in the holes in my house and paint the repairs?

Has a small non adjustable motion detection area. Battery takes a while to charge. Night vision is good, but the motion area is half what it sees. We bought another floodlight camera, where we wanted this one placed, has a wired light so no battery charging and motion area way larger. This little battery camera can be out anywhere, so that is a plus. If you had a small area, with good wifi signal, might be okay. We have no problem with WiFi on the floodlight camera, even though in same area. This tiny camera is easy to move, so might be better inside.

The ring stick up cam is in the front of the house and sadly the linked events are worthless, my doorbell cam picks up everything perfectly and this camera thats right in front of the house picks up ghosts passing by or it doesn't even catch it at all, you see a passing unidentifiable myst. I was excited to get this cam because I really like my doorbell but it's all a joke. My doorbell picks up an event and the other one is super delayed where sometimes it shows nothing, but my doorbell does.

Both priced the same. Noting the difference is one gets a battery only, and the other the 120v outlet plug only. Just to be fully covered, I bought the battery here as well afterwards.

Its great that the battery charges in the unit when plugged it and keeps it on standby at 100%. No where does it mention this nor has anyone commented about this. But you heard it from me...IT DOES. Its awesome. The app heath mode even shows the Power Source (outlet) and battery level %...the charging icon shows up in the corner if charging. Occasionally, I'll unplug it from the UPS outlet to keep the battery lifecycle in check (never good to keep rechargeable batteries (NiCd, NiMH, LiIon) in standby/trickle mode long term).

Generation 3 camera should have the same if not better motion zone settings than previous generations and other/older Ring cameras. Three partial zones that can only be turned on or off is so below what I believe Ring standards should be. I don't understand why this camera was released with anything less.
Please hurry up and update the motions settings as this is a required feature on any camera.

236,"I knew going in that a paid subscription was required to record videos. What I didn't know was that once motion is detected the response time is too slow to bring up a live view in a reasonable amount of time. 20-30 seconds most times and often it fails to bring up the live view at all. So slow/no live view plus no video to review equals pretty useless. We also have Arlo cameras which have a similar response time to live view, but the FREE videos are always recorded.

Update: 2/19/2020
I was contacted by Ring Support shortly after posting my review. I must say that their support team is first rate. They helped me change some of my router settings which improved the response time dramatically. The response time for live view is now around 2-3 seconds most of the time. As a result of this excellent service, I'm upgrading my review from 3 to 5 stars.

I cant connect to it after it being in the same spot for 2 months, and if it does connect it shows a bunch of lines and that's it. I contacted Amazon about this problem and they were no help at all all they would say was, it was older then 3 months by a couple days and they can't refund nor replace camera. All I got was they would have someone from the tech team contact me and thats been days ago. Havent heard nothing. Very upset about this. I would not buy im sure there are better options out there. Look elsewhere. I would have ablot more to say if it didn't go the way it did with Amazon. They own the company ring lol and yet they still can't do anything for me.

238,"The first 30 days (refund period) the camera seemed to work great! Once that period was up, we have had nothing but issues. For one, maybe on my end, you HAVE to pay the subscription fee if you are unable to view a notification at the time it notifies. Which comes to another issue, maybe 50% of the time at best, will the camera actually connect and allow live viewing. For my wife, it is even less likely that it will connect for live viewing. And the battery life is horrendously short. It lasted about the first month before needing recharged, but in the roughly 1.5 months we've had it, its gone through the battery almost 3 times. This is simply on my front door with an average of maybe 3-5 times a day it should go off. We got these to replace our Arlo cameras that were 3 years old and starting to have issues.

242,"Having had a Ring Doorbell for years. It's outstanding. So, when I was looking for some security cams, the ring stick up cam was a no-brainer to choose. Unfortunately,

1) The unit does swivel on the mount. But, it is very limited and not enough for several of my Cams

2) The ""non-stop power"" is simply plugging in the cam. There is an optional battery pack, which would seem useful as it would protect against someone unplugging the cam in order to disable it. However, it is not clear whether the cam will trickle charge the battery. When I called Ring support, the person first told me that the cam does not accept a battery, when I pointed out that the web site says the cam does take an optional battery, she rechecked and finally checked and told me that it does not trickle charge the battery and that I can expect to have to charge them every 6 months. Can't tell if I got the correct answer, but that is a disappointing situation

3) One of 7 cams blinks a slow red when plugged into the nearest outlet (but works when plugged into a more distant outlet with an extension cord). Slow red blinking is not documented. Support line claimed that it was a firmware version problem. I don't know what it is, but it is (1) not a firmware problem if it will work in a different outlet and (2) this is bad support",3,-0.6238,Negative,246

Also even with a paid subcription you don't have the option to ""people only"" so if you have cats/dogs in your yard you will get constant notifications. It covers a much smaller range as the spotlight cam, I would say 1/2 of the space as the spotlight does. The siren is not as loud as other models of ring cameras, I would say is pretty much useless as is SO quiet which defeats the whole point of being a siren.

Mostly because there is now NO support at all from Ring/Amazon. The ""Contact Support"" options on the site are gone and just suggest getting help from the ""Community"". Forums does not equal support.

Second, the motion settings on these cameras are very bad, undocumented, and not consistent. According to documentation, the motion on a battery operated camera triggers a 20 second recording. Another setting will stop the recording if the motion stops. Finally, a third article suggests a new feature is being rolled out that makes this adjustable from 15 to 60 seconds.

None of these are true on my devices. My devices record for 15 seconds following initial motion and then stop regardless of whether the motion continues or not. Further, they also seem to save battery life by then not responding to further motion for some undocumented period of time.

Ring/Amazon seems to have no clue of how a ""security"" device should function. If there are things happening, record it. Don't record the first 15 seconds of something and then turn off for 5-10 minutes. What about that helps in a real world situation.

Note that the settings on the camera have been downgraded to the minimum to conserve battery life. Alright, so this cam has features that it can be powered with a solar attachment or directly connected to electrical power. But, why advertise that its battery life is 3-6 months?

Additionally, there are often false positives when shadows from trees moves, and the motion zones distance cannot be adjusted. There are three large motion zones that can be turned on and off, which is practically useless. And sometimes it fails to pick up motion if it’s within a few minutes of previous motion.

The camera cannot be mounted sideways or upside down since the motion zone and the orientation are stuck in the upright position and not invertible. You have to buy a special mount to mount it upright to the ceiling.

The only access to internet is through my Verizon Jetpack with data speed caps that were already too low for what I need. But my home has no windows on the driveway side and the only way to see if someone is here is to open a door! Not very safe!

I've had the camera in use for about a month now and I love it! I don't use the continous recording service and most times I turn off motion detection. I work at home, so I can usually hear if someone is in my driveway. I can tap the live view in the Ring app and take a quick look - SAFELY, without opening a door!

I used the motion detection feature for about a week when I first installed the camera. It was great! I had it set to the highest sensitivity because I wanted to pick up movement at the far end of my driveway too. It worked! I love the option to choose ""at home"" mode, which keeps live view quickly available if I need it. ""Away"" mode is set up to detect motion and alert me.

I gave a low rating for wiFi signal, but I know that isn't a flaw of the camera - it's simply the trade-off for living in an area with no neighbors (or high-speed internet services.)

After playing with the other 3 that I also purchased and getting frustrated and walking away they 1 by 1 started working without me even touching them. Once I had them all working installing them was easy. I then switched to using the solar panels and all 4 cameras died over night. I’ll try moving the panels into more direct sunlight and hope that helps. In the mean time I’m trying to switch the power mode back to battery and again running into so many complications. Why wouldn’t these switch to battery mode on their own? Even though I charged the battery over night, ran the cameras on solar panels until they died in one night, I still need to charge the battery before I can switch to battery mode. I thought the batteries were supposed to last 3 months. What a pain these have become. I will say for the (very few) short hours these worked they were wonderful.

*UPDATE* An associate from Ring saw this review and set up an appointment to help figure out the issues. From the phone call I learned my battery died quickly because I had it set to WIRE mode while plugged into the solar panel which is the incorrect setting, it should still be on battery mode.

271,"Ring acknowledges these have connectivity issues and fail often trying to do a live view. Just look in the Ring Users forum and you will see it over and over. Our 2 Ring Stick Up Wired cameras are basically worthless since I can't do live view and motion detection is very sparse and random. I drove our cars in front of the camera into the garage and the camera did not sense anything. If I get on a ladder in front of the camera about 2-3 feet away it will detect movement. And yes the settings are correct for maximum distance and as sensitive movement as possible.

I have spent hours resetting the camera, options, etc and even purchased a new Mesh system to see if that helps. It did not. The camera will just not do a live view. I'm currently sitting next to the camera and router. The camera always gets a ""streaming error"" when trying to do a live view. It is just a flaw in the camera.

The app also report a critically low battery even though these are wired units without a battery. Another issue Ring is aware of but has not corrected. Ring's solution is to insert a battery and see if that works. SMH!

Our Ring 3 Plus doorbell on the other hand works just fine. I was hoping to have a homogeneous set of doorbell and cameras but that does not appear to be an option. I will look to another vendor for a camera solution.

On one end of the wire is the plug which goes into the AC outlet which is understandably large. The new design on the other end is a right angle plug to go into the camera itself. the issue is that you have to make an extremely large hole in the wall to get the right angle plug through. My previous cameras have a straight plug so no large hole required. Called customer service about the issue and she said that most people use it in an apartment.

The install location is different than the delivery location so I decided to open the box before I got to the location, check the battery and maybe do a test set-up (9/17/2020). I'd previously read either in the product information or in an 'Answer' given by a Ring rep on Amazon that batteries are usually at least 70% charged upon arrival. I plugged it in. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes. I unplugged it from the computer and plugged it in to a wall thinking maybe it would charge better. 60 minutes, 90 minutes and on and on. So I didn't go that day. Left it on the charger overnight. The green light was on the next morning so I unplugged it, got ready to leave. Before I left, I popped the battery in per instructions and Alexis or whoever's voice that is, lets me know that my battery should be fully charged before set-up. HUH? I just took it off the charger and hour or so ago.

I pop the battery out, put it on the charger and sure enough the green light is gone? Seriously, its been an hour since it was fully charged and it wasn't in the camera during that hour. I wait for it to fully charge again, forgo the test setup and go to the location. I sit in the car and start the set-up again. Yep - BATTERY SHOULD BE FULLY CHARGED BEFORE SET-UP, its been30 minutes!!! LOL. I just continue with the set-up to make sure the wi-fi & everything works. For over 20 minutes it said to wait up to 5 minutes for updates. I finally closed & reopened the app and after a total of 30+ minutes it connected.

Everything seemed fine. The motion was alerting instantly while I was in the car. By then, the install location was full of people so I decided to wait to do the install. Popped the battery out and sure enough when I got back in a few hours later, it needed charging. So, needless to say, I'm worried that this battery that literally won't last 2 hours, is never going to last 2 years.

It also comes with an AC extension cord incase there is no outlet within 8' of where the camera is mounted. I am an electrician / electronics technician with 30+ years experience and see no way to do a professional installation without replacing or modifying the suppled power cord.

I Plan on returning this product unless ring or some kind of customer service member contacts me to either find a solution to the problem because it seems as if their (ring) products are the problem/issue. I’m considering a more reliable and traditional alarm system through the reputable brands we all see and hear of. Not a happy customer at all to have spent close to 400$ to have my batteries die in less than a week of operation. I feel as if you might as well be using cheap dollar store batteries.

For about five years, I have used Arlo cameras at other properties and have always been pretty happy with their ease-of-use and functionality. However the location am I needed to monitor in this case would make it inconvenient to have to change batteries as I do with the Arlo, and at this time hardwiring is not an option. The capacity to add a solar panel to keep the batteries charged is what attracted me to this product. After several days it has completely fulfilled my expectations. Camera is sending me alerts whenever workers are moving around on the property and also sent me some cool video of deer moving at the edge of the field of view, indicating good sensitivity across the monitored area. The app was also easy to set up on my iPhone and has been working very well.

Location of the camera is about 60 or 70 feet across from a standard router supplied by the cable company that is located inside a small outbuilding on the property. I have been concerned about whether the camera would connect were intended to place it, but that worked just fine so the sensitivity seems to be pretty Location of the camera is about 60 or 70 feet across from a standard router supplied by the cable company that is located inside a small outbuilding on the property.

349,"I have had 2 Ring battery operated cameras installed on the exterior of my home since October 2019. Thankfully I have not had any attempted break-ins at my home, as I only recently discovered the cameras will only record for 30 seconds from the moment it detects motion (20 seconds for cameras activated since March 2020). And I only detected this when a contractor drive down my driveway, parked and walked to my front door. The camera did its job and started recording when it detected the vehicle on the driveway, but by the time the contractor exited his vehicle, walked to and rang the door, and my wife walked to and opened the door, Ring had already been recording for 27 seconds. So, imagine the same scenario and the person, after exchanging pleasentries assaults my wife; there would have no recording, as the 30 seconds of recording would have ended.

I jumped on the internet to determine how I could lengthen the recording time, even at the expense of battery life. After all, I had already bought an extra battery as the promoted battery life is a farce. I discovered something called a ""Ring Community,"" where Ring consumers can ask product questions and Ring ""Community Managers"" allegedly act as a go-between between the customer and Ring developers. I discovered that this issue was raised by a number of Ring customers starting back in July 2019, who have since become very unsatisfied Ring customers, and now some are ex-Ring customers. Despite the Community Managers' standard line of, ""Rest assured that us moderators are reviewing every new post and reply as they come in, ... and take your feedback seriously,"" they ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CARE about customer satisfaction. If they did, they would listen and enable the customer to set the record time, certainly well beyond 30 seconds. Instead, Ring spent months modifying their software to do the exact opposite; now customers have the ability to REDUCE the record time. What break-in occurs within a time period of LESS THAN 30 seconds? Ring customers who have been victims of break-ins have been among those who have provided feedback to Ring within Ring's ""Ring Community,"" expressing the need for longer recording ability. But all Ring has done is attempt to pacify with their same propaganda that they take customer feedback seriously, and have achieved nothing but infuriating those who have spent their money on a very inferior product. Eleven (11) months have passed since the complaints about the inadequate recording time began within the ""Ring Community;"" and Ring has done nothing positive to improve their cameras.

If you are in the market for a ""security"" camera that will actually record the full range of activity of a visitors with questionable intentions DO NOT buy a Ring camera. You may be temporarily satisfied with its abilities, like I was, up to the point where you realize it won't be there for you when you actually need it! A number of people on the aforementioned ""Ring Community"" thread regarding the recording length have determined that a battery operated camera called ""Arlo"" allows the user to determine the recording length. I have not yet investigated the ""Arlo"" camera, but plan to. $230 down the drain, but live and learn. For safety reasons and terrible customer service I'd give it a ZERO if I could.

My only real disappointment with the camera is that it lacks a lot of the more advanced motion setting adjustments that are available on the other camera models. No matter what adjustments I make on this one, I find that it gets a lot of recordings of cars driving by down the street but often ignores me getting into my car right in front of it. Often times it only notices me as I am driving away. In 3 months I have gotten video of only one group of car checkers. Not sure if it is because it's less prevalent on our street or if the camera just doesn't pick them up.

394,"Pros: easy to install But...!!

BIG CON: cannot control length of recording!! Even when it’s plugged-in and not run on battery alone. Essentially stops recording even when motion activity is ongoing. Thus important activities are always cut short and you don’t get to see what happens!

Many have reported this issue on the Ring forum and judging by the responses from the Ring team, this setting nowhere close to being resolved. The most they’re willing to do is to eventually implement a 60 second recording setting on battery-powered devices (default is 30 sec on battery) but this changes nothing for plugged-in devices where the max. default is already 60 seconds.

It’s been suggested by others to change the Motion Frequency setting to “frequent” so that, in theory, a new recording will begin right away if the motion continues. But this isn’t a reliable solution and still misses potentially critical activities that might occur in the seconds between the recordings.

Unfortunately I’ve passed my return window on all of my Ring cameras but this is a big enough issue that I’m going to spend more money to buy different cameras as replacements. Any criminal who might be familiar with Ring cameras will know to just wait out the set recording time in order to avoid being caught in the act.

Had a strange car pull in past my house today and the camera didn't record until the car was nearly past my house. Can't go live most of the time. And it doesn't always turn on when there's motion. But when it's windy it goes off constantly.",5,0.9612,Positive,179

421,"So, I was fairly worried upon purchasing this stick-up Security camera (as an addition to our first ring doorbell security camera)— mainly due to the fact that we live in the dessert, and it gets extremely dark where we live @ night as we are outside of the main downtown/city area. I was concerned that even if we kept the back porch light on each night, the night vision would still not be sufficient enough to pick up on movement/a person (should someone attempt to hop our brick wall fence).
I was pleasantly surprised to find that this camera’s capabilities were MORE than sufficient enough to do the job!
In fact, every time I go to let my golden retriever outside to go potty @ night...I’ll get blown up with the Ring app notifications I set up on my cell phone: “Motion detected in your backyard”. My dog is still a VERY CURIOUS puppy, and since he’s not used to seeing this camera in his backyard...he likes to go and check it out every 5 minutes when I let him out there, 😂.
I don’t mind it....at least I know the camera is working fine & dandy!
We will be purchasing another identical camera very soon for our garage.
OH! And trust me when I say that if you’re reading this in search for your next system (as a 1st time owner)....you should stop looking at all of the bajillion other security cam systems now, for one simple reason:
THE NEIGHBORS APP!
You can see any posts made by neighbors! Basically, you tell the Ring Neighbors app to alert you of any new posts made within a specified radius of your home—and you can customize which areas around your home you’d like to include. Just select what you want to see updates about...thefts, neighborly events, suspicious activity, and etc.

We (my boyfriend and I) spent 2 months contemplating/going back & forth constantly on the various security systems offered, their specifications, and blah blah blah.
I wish we would’ve went with this right away! So user friendly, great technology w/easy to use apps for viewing instantaneously w/ease, 24/7 tech support available...AND the ability to see what’s happening nearby/in your neighborhood, to help protect you and your neighbors?
All of this puts the Ring system leaps & bounds ahead of it’s top competitors! They’ve made us loyal customers for life! :)",5,0.9946,Positive,399
422,"Unless your wifi is right next to it, it is totally worthless. I'm running a Netgear Nighthawk router with an extender near the camera and it is totally worthless.

423,"I like that this camera has a very clear video quality even at night when using the night vision option. I also like that it has a long cable to connect it directly to an available outlet for easy installation. The camera itself feels and looks much better than the smaller indoor camera that we bought a while ago. I think the only two negative things I found on this camera are that the motion detection is not always very accurate when it comes to only detecting people after setting it to only detect humans it also ends up detecting animals and sometimes cars for some reason, I think it might have something to do with the camera angle. The only other thing I found a little frustrating is that they removed the option to flip the camera view when you mount it upside down. I just assumed that it had this option since it was available in our first indoor ring camera we bought a while back.
I guess now I will be forced to buy the available hardware they offer to mount it upside down.",4,0.6582,Positive,187
424,I liked how easy they were to install. Now that I've had a little time to think about this great item. Back up battery charger... I bought the solar powered camera.

But I'll have it when I need it.😉👌,5,0.9151,Positive,73
425,"I don’t normally write reviews, but I feel like I have duty to write one in this case. These cameras are truly awful. Honestly, if you want motion detection, run in the other direction as quickly as you can.

Now, the more thorough version: the motion detection in this camera is quite limited in its manual options (you can’t manually draw an area where you want the camera to focus its motion detection on, for example) and the automatic options are fairly useless. The motion area simply divides the picture in three (imagine a half circle with three 40-degree angles meeting at the lens, like pizza slices) and you can decide which ones to turn on or off, which is limiting to begin with, but they also don’t work very well.

Most importantly, this camera never picks up motion quickly (with or without “motion verification” turned on). I have my camera set up so it covers the length of the alley leading up from the sidewalk to my front door (~30 feet). I’d say the success rate of it picking up a person walking to my front door is maybe 20%, and the success rate with someone walking back is maybe 40%. So, you will likely get no alert at all, or the alert will only show the person walking back, which is not that useful.

Also, Ring has decided that they would rather have you buy a weird looking adapter than let you simply reverse the image in the even the camera gets mounted upside down on a ceiling).

Finally, I’d suggest a quick search on the web regarding Ring’s privacy policy - it will tell you a lot about the company.

Without paying at least $3 to $10 every month, all you get is the live view, which, due to the motion sensor delay is worthless. You cannot even view a video or picture from 1 minute ago without the subscription, so this will be my last Ring product, ever. This product should read: $99 + $30 every year. Very disappointed, and I read that Blink, Arlo and all other similar products are subscription based - so you have been warned! No functionality without paying for the Ring ""Cloud"".

You’d think because these products belong to the same family they would have the same technology as the Door Bell and the Spotlight but I found out that’s not the case.

edit: updated from a pissed off 1 star to 4 stars. I got a call from a great service rep at ring who explained from the way the IR sensors are angled, upside down would not work for the motion sensing. Also it will pop up and recommend the mount if you add to cart, but not if you click buy it now. So not as stupid as I first thought, but still a bad design - they should still include a mount for a camera, cameras are normally mounted...on the ceiling.

I will say though, another nice feature is there's a ring community that's included in the app and anyone who has had any suspicious behavior or any crimes near us, shows up which is also nice.

So I’m not sure where they are getting that.,4,-0.803,Negative,78

1024,This is more a matter of preference for me. I have a ring doorbell pro already and thought this would be similar. I found out that the plug in and battery powered versions are very different. I highly recommend the plug in versions but the battery powered are just ok. This version is 2.4ghz only. I ended up with buying a plug in stick up cam that is duel band 2.4 and 5ghz.,2,0.2699,Positive,73

2136,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 On paper, this camera is great. It has battery and solar options so you don't have to wire your house to support it. The two way voice functionality is great. I get to see video snippets of animals crossing my yard or the mailman delivering mail. I have four cameras with overlapping coverage so I feel like I get a good sense of what is going on at my house when I'm not there.

I was notified of a break in when the my accompanying ring alarm went off and I got a call from them asking if I should call the police. I checked the cameras.

IT DID NOT RECORD THE ACT OF BREAKING IN. Due to the 30s recording limit per event (which was recently dropped to 20s), it shows the person looking into my windows. The recording cuts out after 30 seconds. The next video from any of my cameras is him leaving the house from the same window because he tripped the alarm. (See attached video. I cropped and blurred for privacy purposes).

When I filed a police report, the person who took my statement mentioned that it may be difficult to use the video as proof since it doesn't actually show him breaking in.

BEWARE if you're planning on buying this as a security product.

I can't post links in reviews, but search for ""site:community.ring.com video recording length"" where people complained about the short video recording length. It was recently marked as ""solved"" when Ring mentioned they are rolling out recording length options, but the max is still 30 seconds.",1,0.4944,Positive,272
2137,"I have the 2nd gen ring stick up cam and love it,orig.$179 got it on sale for $129.so what does ring do ? They come out with this watered down version for $99 missing some awesome features,the one that bothers me most is i would have to buy a the mount( the one that's on the 2nd gen also the new Elite which I'll get to in a moment) if i want to mount to a ceiling,approximately another $25 including shipping.So basically what they did was put the siren,the POE,and the what was once the standard bracket on the so called ""ELITE"" which is really just the second gen and now charge $199.was going to buy another stick up 2nd gen but not for $200 ! I'll stick with what I have till they stop overcharging for the 2nd gen. I refuse to pay more just because they change the name, absolutely ridiculous!",1,-0.7766,Negative,153
2138,"I have spent hours working with Ring trying to get their camera to work. I have a mounted 3 Stick up cameras all facing the front yard area and have about 30 feet away. They pick up cars and not all pick up the same motion. They sometimes pick up people walking by on the sidewalk who's dogs defecate an urinate on my lawn, but not all camera's pick up the motion even though the motion did occur in front of all cameras. I have adjusted frequency, sensitivity, customized motion zones, sent clips in to ring, given them access to the cameras, you name it. In addition, the video is does pick up is low quality, chopy and fuzzy. They've said, it's because they are battery unit vs wired and I don't have a wired option which is WHY I bought these battery cameras as they are advertised to work. They do NOT work as advertised. Plus, on the few occasions they do detect the motion of people, they do NOT recognize them as people even though they are set to Advanced Detection. Which Ring says should work, however having it in that mode may miss events. But even when it is not in Advanced Detection, they still miss picking up the motion of anything but cars on almost all occasions and even then not all of them pick up the motion. Plus, the almost all of the video is choppy and fuzzy with some of it frozen or blacked out. They fall off line for no reason even when I had installed Mesh network with satellites less than 15 feet from the camera's. Ring has claimed it was because they were battery, receiving weak single strength, that the settings weren't adjusted properly, the angle was not good, or the elevation was not good. I have mitigated everything they have claimed to be the cause and spent HOURS working with them and yet still the camera's do NOT work as advertised.

In addition, as I began trying to troubleshoot this with Ring, and they were to send a replacement camera for one of them. After 3 weeks of them claiming it was stuck in logistics, they sent the wrong camera replacement.

RING tech support told me those missing features were still there as long as I bought the plug in version of Gen 3. Well... I went up to my local Best Buy and bought one. Low and behold I was right they removed those features. I placed my old and new cameras side by side and the new one didn’t start record until several seconds after I walked past. My old camera in the other hand showed everything. The new camera didn’t even show me as I walked past at a brisk pace. I got the alert but not video of my body in the shot. The new one also didn’t let me draw the custom motion zones as they told me I would be able to. This also goes to show that even their Tech Support isn’t interested in really knowing their own products. They should be required to have them at least in a lab and when you ask them a direct question be able to test before lying to you. I’m very disappointed with RING why would they remove features from better versions??? If you want those wired features of the Gen 2s then don’t get these. If you were happy with the limited Battery features of Gen 2 then these are a slight improvement. The only good thing about Gen 3 is that they let you blackout areas for privacy like my bed so it doesn’t record my girlfriend and I going at it. Lol

——-
I own the Gen 2 wired version of these. I was going to buy more of these and noticed that the price was dropped and it was now called Gen 3. I immediately got excited until I did some research. The Gen 3 model lacks features that the Gen 2 had. I’m not sure why they made it less featured but they apparently did. The Gen 3 lacks the ability to draw your own motion zones to avoid motion areas such as fish tanks, bird cages etc. you basically get the less customizable motion zones seen with the old Gen 2 battery versions. The Gen 3 also lacks the 3 seconds of Pre-motion that the Gen 2 would add onto your motion clips so you could see what happened just before motion was detected. This was very useful when objects moved in and out of frame quickly. Additionally the mounting bracket on the Gen 3 is also less adjustable than the Gen 2 version. And lastly the field of view is more narrow meaning you get less in your camera view. The Gen 2 version I have can practically see everything to the immediate left and right of it. The Gen 3 cuts out most of the left and right and for my placement it wouldn’t work. These Gen 3 are great if you are someone who had the Gen 2 battery versions and don’t mind missing the extra features I listed below. However if you had the Gen 2 wired version before, then these Gen 3 wired versions seem to downgrade you to the features of the old battery versions. I think I’ll try to find some older Gen 2 wired versions or consider the Elite version which I believe has the missing features mentioned above.",2,0.9845,Positive,549
2142,"This Ring Stick Up camera is wall-mounted in a garage.

There is a small step down from the house when entering the garage. So, I use the camera to monitor a person who has mobility and stability issues, when they enter and walk around the garage to empty trash one or two times each day.

I do receive timely alerts when there is activity. However, when I click on the ""Rapid Ring"" app -- it boots ""rapidly,"" but the app is very slow to produce a live image. As mentioned, the person I monitor has mobility issues and is subsequently a slow walker. Nevertheless, by the time Ring produces a live image, the person has already returned into the house.

THE GOOD:
- The video is clear and sharp.
- The night vision is excellent (see attached night vision shot).
- The Ring Stick Up camera looks and feels like a quality product.
- The price of the product is ""somewhat"" reasonable.
- The Ring ""Rapid"" app starts quickly and without hesitation.

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:
- The ""Live View"" takes way too long to load, and sometimes, the Live View hangs and never loads.
- By the time Live View loads, the subject has completely left the monitored area.
- It is expensive to add multiple Ring cameras to your security system (as compared to other cameras).
- The Motion Zones are FIXED, and can NOT be customized (like the Ring doorbells).

DETAILS OF MY SET UP:
- The Ring Stick Up is operated directly by electricity (not by a battery).
- Cable Internet speed tests consistently at 175 Mbps UP and 11 Mbps DOWN.
- The Ring and the Ring Rapid apps are on a Pixel XL with 128 MB of memory.
- The network is Google ""mesh"" (4 nodes), and the router node is located in a room next to the garage.
- Standing in the garage, the Pixel XL download speed averages 160 Mbps, so the area's WiFi signal is strong.

SIDEBAR THOUGHTS:
In addition to the Ring Home Security System, I have a RING PRO DOORBELL on the same network. The doorbell is connected to a new 16v/30w transformer, so there is adequate power being supplied to the doorbell. Yet, I have the SAME PROBLEM with Live View loading slowly or sometimes not at all.

In fact, by the time I hear the Ring Pro Doorbell ""motion alert,"" activate Ring Rapid on the mobile phone, and establish a ""Live View"" for the Ring Doorbell -- very often the delivery person is already back in his/her truck and driving away.

Therefore, since the S-L-O-W to Live View happens on both Ring Pro Doorbell and the Ring Stick Up Camera, and both devices are on a reasonably fast network, I am left to believe the slowness of establishing Live View is systemic with all of Ring's products.

ONE OTHER DISLIKE ABOUT THE RING STICK UP CAMERA:
The software lacks a sophisticated ""Motion Zones"" function (like the Ring Doorbell with customizable zones). Instead, the motion zones on the Ring Stick Up camera are limited to just THREE FIXED ZONES that can NOT be moved or manipulated. The zones are located at the bottom of the screen, which does NOT allow for controlling motion activity in the upper areas of the screen if needed.

RELATIVE COSTS:
In addition to the Ring Stick Up camera, I have FIVE fixed-position Wyze cameras. Obviously, the FIVE Wyze cameras cover more areas than one Ring camera, however, the cost of FIVE Wyze cameras was $125 vs. $99 for ONE Ring camera.

Personally, I believe a $25 Wyze camera performs ""nearly as well"" as the $99 Ring Stick Up Camera. Yes, the Stick Up Camera produces a better and sharper video image than a $25 Wyze Camera. But, is the image quality of the $99 Ring camera FOUR TIMES BETTER than a $25 Wyze camera? No. (To be fair, mounting a Wyze camera outdoors is not supported by Wyze, and the Ring Stick Up Camera can be mounted indoors or outdoors, and that in itself is a value within its $99 price.)

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION:
As long as your video security needs are ""residential"" in nature, not mission-critical, you don't need exacting controls over Motion Zones, and you can live with possible VERY slow load times for Live View -- this is an ""okay"" camera for indoor/outdoor security needs.

VALUE:
Would I purchase another $99 Ring camera instead of a $25 Wyze camera? That would depend on the need or task of the security camera. However, the likely answer is -- no. The Ring Stick Up Camera has dropped significantly in price over the last few months. Still, considering the competition, I think $50 to $60 would be a more realistic price point for this product.",2,0.9963,Positive,800
2143,"In 2020, I installed 5 Ring exterior cameras (Floodlight cams and Spotlight cams) outside my home and 4 at another location, 30 minutes away. Supposedly these have a 12 month warranty. After 8 months, the video camera on one Floodlight camera randomly loses its picture every few days. The only way to fix it is drive 30 minutes and turn the power off and back on at the circuit breaker panel. No other device has this problem and no other solution fixes it.
I’ve been trying for weeks to get this replaced under warranty. I’ve wasted hours searching their website, endless chat sessions, and frustrating phone calls. But the Ring website and App take you down a series of dead ends. There are no web-based “helps” that enable you to explain the situation and file a claim for replacement.
“Send us an email” they say, but you’ll get an automated reply that they don’t respond to emails. “Chat with us”, they say, but there is no “chat about defective product” option and whoever you chat with can’t help you, but promises to have someone follow up (which never happens). “Call us” they say, but you end up speaking (after a long wait) with a nice earnest person with marginal English skills, who can’t help you, but promises to have a supervisor call you back (which doesn’t happen either). So they effectively neuter their warranty by stonewalling you, and you end up with no security protection from that device.

2144,"EDIT: For all the reviews stating it doesn't integrate with the alarm, You can go to the settings page of the Base Station, click Linked Devices. From there you can pick which cameras start recording when your alarm goes off.

So far I mostly like these cameras, I'm using two of them mounted outdoors. I also have the new Indoor camera and what I find odd, is the indoor camera has the option to invert the video if you mount the camera upside down. For whatever reason these cameras do no have that feature you must buy the $19 mount kit if you want to mount to a ceiling. Aggravating but, okay.

My biggest issue is the mount kit isn't available right now. It's currently Oct. and Amazon states they won't have them in until. Dec 8th.

As far as the camera goes, it does well and is exactly what I thought it would be. A slightly worse version of the wired / POE versions for the expense of a simple install. I'm perfectly okay with making that trade off.

The picture quality is acceptable, but not amazing. It is considerably better than the Blink XT2 which I'm replacing with these. Also another plus is the FOV is much wider at 130 degrees vs the XT2's mediocre 110.

Motion detection for me has been mostly good and I think once tweaked properly they should serve most peoples needs. Again, this is battery powered and they have to make compromises to ensure a decent battery life.

Another pro is the fact that this uses the same standard battery as the spotlight cams and doorbell.

Overall if you need a wireless outdoor solution, these are pretty hard to beat at $100.",4,0.9755,Positive,289
2145,"I pre-ordered both this and the newest indoor camera at the same time. The indoor camera arrived first and was setup first.

Imagine my surprise when the outdoor camera came and I was not able to setup precisely defined motion zones! It's a serious limitation of this device and probably a deal killer for many people.

If you are familiar with other ring devices, such as the doorbells, it's very easy to take small squares in the setup and drag them to a shape in order to indicate a motion detection zone (when you are alerted to activity and also when the camera start to record and send the video to Ring's cloud).

You cannot do that with this device. Instead, you are given a pie shaped graphic over your camera image with 3 zones and an intensity setting. It's very imprecise and in my limited testing simply does not work well at all. No alert and no recording! It's one of the main reason I purchased this device.

At this point, I'm considering getting another indoor camera and using it outdoors (I'll take my chances, it's covered by an soffit). Frankly, the indoor camera works better and has better image quality. It's also smaller (because a large portion of the outdoor camera is taken up with a cavity for a battery- that's not included in this model).

2147,"Update 7/3/20:
Ring customer support has reached out to me to offer a replacement camera at an additional charge that does what this camera was supposed to do. Additionally the replacement powers over ethernet, has ethernet, works with smartthings, has color night vision, and has a wider viewing area. That camera is the 2nd generation stick up camera, now known as the stick up camera elite. It is more expensive, but a better camera all around, though the price increase may not be worth it if you aren't considering running ethernet.

It's baffling why the 3rd generation camera even exists.

Ring customer support was excellent to work with after they contacted me, but getting to someone who is familiar with their products was not possible without them contacting me. I was told the 3rd generation plug in camera will feature motion zones someday, but there is no ETA on that update. Currently privacy zone masks can be used in the same way as motion zones on the 3rd generation camera, but video won't be viewable outside of the motion zones.

Update 6/4/20:
Ring did get some of the low battery messages fixed in a software update. The video feed from this camera is now working in the app... so two stars for making a camera in which the footage can be viewed. Still has crippled motion zones and Rings customer service is still terrible. As a security camera, there are better cameras with more functionality from more honest sellers for less money. You are paying extra for advanced tech, a seamless app and customer service experience and an honest company. Without that, this cameras feature set can be matched for $20.

Original Review:

First off, most importantly, the Wired version of the Ring Stick Up Cam doesn't work. Features are limited because the Ring App sees the battery (which isn't included) as ""Critically Low"". This includes viewing the Live Feed using the App. There is a work around if you have click for live view enabled. Why would a brand new product currently for sale from a reputable company not be able to do the one thing it is supposed to do right out of the box??? Unless this camera is a cash grab and no one at Ring tested this before release.

Ring themselves don't seem to know much about this camera. Their specs and help files list different versions of this camera, which you're supposed to know despite nothing on the box indicating what version this is. Since it doesn't match the instructions for the stick up cam generation 1 or 2... I am left to assume it is generation 3, but Ring says there's a USB power cable with that model... so who knows? I purchased the wired version because I needed to set motion zones, which Ring's website clearly indicates is possible on the ring stick up cam wired (see attached photos from rings website). Amazon says advanced motion sensor features are coming soon... it's possible today, as the privacy zones work, so don't believe that load. All that is available - likely because of the Ring app views it as a battery camera - is a PIR sensor, which either sees everything or nothing, based on some arbitrary slider. It can't even limit the distance the PIRs trigger. According to the app fine tuning motion detection is based on turning off one or two of the three sensors, or by... I guess the amount of time the intruder is being sensed? Again, that's what the app says... that's their advanced motion detection. I'm guessing the PIRs performance change wildly based on temperature because 1) They don't work at all when tuned to the point that they don't trigger constantly and 2) they are PIRs.

I'm also assuming, since the setup specifically asks if you have a wired camera, that the battery problems were introduced as a hasty way of disabling the motion zone feature inherently available in the camera in an effort to sell more expensive cameras (as battery operation cancels out advanced motion detection).

Since Live View doesn't work out of the box, the best feature of the product doesn't work and was likely intentionally disabled to sell more expensive devices (again Privacy Zones don't trigger motion, therefor motion zones are hardware and software possible), Ring doesn't know which camera this is (3rd generation but their manual is wrong?), it's time to contact support.

No can do. No support because of... coronavirus I guess. That's code for we didn't want to pay our employees to work from home. I did find after searching for someone to contact that some areas of the website claim their phone support is open. I guess I'll find out tomorrow as I've wasted an entire day setting this one camera up and trying to get it to work. Nothing smart about any of this, except returning it. The only saving grace would be if an official retailer sold me a cheap knock off incompatible product in a brand new Ring box.",2,0.9883,Positive,842
2148,"EDIT JAN 31, 2021

When I first installed this outdoor cam, I was a little sad that it only produced a 720p video. But after upgrading my internet (and router unit) from 180Mbps to 300mbps, the quality of the video improved dramatically to 1080p. I've since upgraded to 1Gbps and the video quality remains at 1080p.

My conclusion is that my initial reaction to the video quality was incorrect and up-revised my review to 5 stars as it works great.

That being said, make sure you have a solid wireless connection to the device (at least 65/100 signal strength) and 300mpbs service if you want the optimal quality video resolution.

---- PREVIOUS ----

So after racking my brain trying to figure out why a 1080p camera gives jagged lines, even with a 200mb internet connection... it's that the camera drops down to 720p (looks almost like 480p) when it can't sense an opposing wall or object. All other tech site reviews show amazing resolution and even my Ring doorbell camera has higher resolution, but ONE site reported 720p resolution if the camera is pushed in trying to see over a distance.

I've got mine mounted above the garage about 15 feet above ground looking down. Distance to end fo drive way is about 21-22 feet.

That being said, if you are looking for a cam to look out over a small porch or about maybe just over a doorway, this is great. But you are looking for something that will sit UP on the eaves of the garage or home, you might need a more robust solution.",5,0.9924,Positive,267
2149,"Installed the plug in camera in my garage yesterday and it’s displaying a critically low battery warning even though it indicates it’s plugged in. This version doesn’t even have a battery! Reviewing online commentary, this is a common defect and the Ring team is supposedly working on it after identifying the root cause. This concerns me as If it was a simple firmware update they should have fixed it already. Hopefully it’s not a hardware issue. I’d hold off on getting this version until you know it’s been fixed. Also, I believe that since the device thinks it has a critically low battery, it’s limiting motion detection and recording. It doesn’t seem to be picking up or recording all motions even at the highest sensitivity.
UPDATE 6/6/2020
The critical battery error went away by itself after several days. I assume Ring pushes a firmware fix. I’m still only giving this camera 3 stars as it doesn’t pick up motion well or record long enough motion events compared to my Ring Floodlight cams. BTW, save yourself a ton of time and just buy the Ring Floodlight cams for your outdoor cam needs. They’re awesome.

You get what you pay for but 10x worst. I have the Home alarm and security cameras and it has been frustration after frustration nightmare. I chose Ring (which I regret immensely) because of the integration with Alexa and price.

The camera is outdated with useless antiquated functions even though it was their latest and greatest at the time of purchase.

Or sending so-called updated parts that do nothing but waste your time on replacing old junk with new junk.

But the most frustrating part is the UN-RELIABLE, sub-par Ring, and Ring Rapid App. I can write a novel of some of the useless features, or non-fuctioning service and half-a** attempt to provide a commonsense interface, but it's just not worth it at the end.",1,-0.9798,Negative,230

2152,"I have four ring cameras. The $60 plug-in indoor one, and three indoor/outdoor battery cameras. I bought the $60 plug-in camera directly from the Ring website--don't make that mistake--the customer service is HORRENDOUS!
I complained about the $60 camera because the plug would not stay in. After almost an hour on the phone, the ring customer service person took my credit card number to charge me if I did not send back the defective one and said she'd send out a new one in five days. I never got the new one. Who knows how that will turn out.
The battery cameras ask you if you are going to be placing the camera to look out a window, yet when I set it up to look out the window, it does not pick up any motion. I can see the changes of nature and weather but no motion alerts. I wasted two long calls to customer service with that one and never got any satisfaction.
The battery ones also do not pick up all motion. The battery one I have set up in my basement is very sporadic on what it picks up and what it does not pick up. Sometimes it picks up people walking into the family room and other times it does not, or it picks up a second or two of someone entering and then cuts out. I bought the battery ones at Costco, so they will be returned before 90 days. Anyone have good information on a good security camera out there?

Motion detection though is not that accurate, even in a daylight with nothing preventing to work well. I've walked few times to the garage back and forth with couple of minutes in between and motion was detected only 60% of the time. On another occasion it only recorded motion from a guy picking up a product I was returning only when he was leaving the garage, even though he walked straight to the camera.

Other annoying thing with Ring is that if you want to save your recorded videos you have to pay, my opinion is that this should be an optional feature for those who'd don't want to manage this and for those of us that have a NAS or somewhere to store recordings we should have a supported option to do so on our own. Or provide cameras for free and charge for the service as some security companies do.

After all, the housing is thin, cheap plastic. There's no premium feel to anything about these cameras or how they function.

As I'll outline later, it's a bit of a ""razor/razorblade"" situation (for those who don't know, that sales concept is that the razor is free but they make their money off selling you razorblades). If you don't subscribe to a Ring Protect plan, they limit the camera's function to a degree that I believe is unacceptable.

Because they limit the functionality without a subscription (some of which was communicated beforehand, some of which I found out after owning it - like the Live View freezing described below - I would fall on the side of not recommending it).

The good:
+ Battery life is pretty good. This was my main concern after reading the reviews. After a month of use, battery is at 88%. Assuming it's linear, that means I'll only be charging these devices every 9-10 months at most.

+ The image quality is pretty good. The sound can be a bit difficult to hear and the viewing angle isn't as good as Arlo but it's passable.

The bad:
- If you don't subscribe to the Ring Protect Plan ($100 year for unlimited devices, $30/year for a single device), they disable ""People Only Mode."" This meant I was getting a lot of alerts when nothing was happening, perhaps a change in shadow or a gust of wind blowing a leaf, who knows. Even when I adjusted motion sensitivity to minimum. This also ate away at my battery. So really you need to go into this knowing that you're signing up for a subscription.

- Even if you do subscribe, the activity monitor is not accurate - again this goes with the comment that this is a budget camera product. I've had packages show up at my door, 7 feet from the camera, with no alert.

- Glitchy Live View. Both of my Stick Up cameras have the same issue which was conveniently fixed after I signed up for the Ring Protect Plan. Before doing so, if I got a motion alert, I would naturally want to look at the Live View. However, both cameras would freeze on ""Activating Device."" What happened was I'd get an alert, and the devices would go dormant for 10 minutes.

- Random shutoffs. One of my devices occasionally just stops working (brand new). This has happened twice in the month I've owned it. I pop out the battery and put it back in and it restarts. I wonder if the battery is just not secure (goes back to lack of premium build quality). If it happens again I'll tape the battery in.

- If your intent is to point the camera down, like at your front door from the side, the max pivot angle before the camera hits its mounting base will likely not work for you. I had to spend $20 on a ceiling mount kit - which honestly should just come with the camera - to provide the camera with enough space to tilt down and capture my entire front door.",3,0.9787,Positive,558
2157,"My cameras work maybe 50% of the time. The are not consistent and cannot be relied on. I have called Ring multiple times and have received multiple excuses including, it might be your siding interfering with the signal, it might be too cold out, and your router/modem might be too far away. I also get messages from ring on the app that say ""Latency has been reported and our engineers are investigating. In the interim you may experience delays connecting to live views and videos or logging into the Ring app completely"". So..if your house doesn't have siding or brick, it doesn't get below freezing where you live, you have a modem/router next to every camera, and you love calling customer service this product may be for you.",1,0.6701,Positive,128
2158,"Pros: Super easy installation - solid construction - stays put - nice night vision illumination

Cons - Video quality is not on part with what I had hoped - motion detection can be somehow too sensitive but also miss things you think are within range - the app is kind of annoying to use

So let me start by saying I don’t mind paying a couple bucks a month for video storage. I work on a field where I get how expensive maintaining and acquiring good reliable servers for large amounts of data can be.

That being said, this camera was mounted pointing at the end of our long drive at the mailbox. Somehow it manages to capture when USPS drives up every day to the mailbox and delivers the mail, but happened to NOT record AT ALL when someone else came along awhile later and took the packages left by the mailbox. So we have no way of knowing who took them or any proof they were even stolen. That’s rather aggravating, but I assume whoever did it didn’t pull their car up and an individual person at that distance just didn’t register on the detection. It’s great though for letting me know the dog walked by or there’s a squirrel in the tree. Thanks Ring. It is handy though for Doordash or Instacart deliveries at the driveway gate and captured those well so far.

Either way, we will be moving our second camera up closer once we get an extension cord long enough or get a solar panel and hopefully avoid that issue.

All in all, for the price I paid during the sale, I feel I got my money’s worth. I was just expecting more reliability and clearer imaging from Ring given their reputation. Not worth returning, but not sure I’ll stick with ring for future purchases.",4,0.756,Positive,310

It’s almost as bad as Alexa in the Amazon app or YouTube Premium on the YouTube app. LOL. I get it, but it’s a missed opportunity for business from some very loyal customers.

2161,"I have a Gen2 Stick up battery cam and I couldn’t have raved about it, promoted it, or recommended it more than I have over the past year.

But since this newer cam came out—at $80 cheaper—I was ecstatic. I couldn’t wait to get one.

Unfortunately, this camera acted nothing like the previous, and the lag between catching a live view from motion notification began to take so long that by the time I finally got the live feed, whatever triggered it was long gone.

Things just became increasingly difficult and frustrating. Much more than they ever had been. I honestly became so discouraged that I returned it. I still have my old stick up cam...which is only 7 months old btw...and I’m keeping that one. But at the moment I’m researching something that might work better and more consistently for my home.

I have the indoor cam on a cabinet about 8 feet high and set the sensitivity at maximum. The camera image is similar to a fish-eye and you'd be hard pressed to positively identify any unknown person through the video. In the kitchen/family room area, if I don't have a dim light on at night, the recorded image is unusable in my opinion even tho it does offer a certain level of security and peace of mind. Having the devices connected to my Alexa is of no value and is a novelty more than anything else. In simple terms, coupled with the $60 a year necessary to preserve videos, given the decision whether to buy again, I'd pass.

2163,"UPDATE Jan 10, 2020:
Ring customer support (Jason from Arizona) contacted me shortly after this review. We ran through all kinds of troubleshooting procedures to get the cams to work. He extended the trial period so I wouldn't get charged until disposition was made. Never did get the outdoor stick-up cams to work even though 1 cam was only 30 feet from the router. He kept in contact with me all through the refund process including receipt until I was satisfied. Again, I have the Doorbell Pro that has always worked perfectly. Because of Jason's persistence in keeping the customer satisfied and made financially whole when things don't work out, I've changed the rating to 4 star.

I bought the cameras to see wildlife activity at the back of my house and at my shed (feeding area) about 50 feet away. Initially, both cameras had a poor Wifi rating but did produce videos. Since I am a Comcast customer, they upgraded my modem to their latest model - got worse. Comcast sold me their Wifi Pods to try - closer camera got better, other got worse - returned the Pods. Moved my router about 25 feet closer and brought both cameras inside to test - Wifi signal was strong - both worked for a while then both stopped - had to reboot cameras. Live view has never worked and always results in a streaming error. Next step is to try the Ring Chime Pro since it only broadcasts to linked devices at 2.4.

Ring - if you're listening - I'm running out of ideas since I'm out of the 30 day window for returns. Please Help.

That being said, I also have the Ring Doorbell Pro and it operates perfectly.",1,0.9223,Positive,290
2164,"Update 3/24/20
Since a recent software update, my cameras do seem to be capturing motion and letting me access live view MOST of the time. I am also enjoying the new home and away settings. I am leaving my 1 star review, however, because the cameras did not work for months and the customer support and service were horrendous. I still can't recommend these cameras.

2/16/20I purchased 4 of these cameras. Of those 4, only 1 is triggered by motion. The other 3 just stay asleep. Even the 1 that does pick up motion will not reliably let me use the live view feature, even on my own wifi right next to my router.

I have reset these cameras numerous times and they still don't work. I have given them reserved IPs and they still don't work. I have spent hours on the phone with Ring tech support and they still don't work.

At one point, tech support admitted that the cameras I have are defective and began to process an exchange. They asked for my receipt and purchase info and when they found out where I had purchased the cameras (a huge retail chain that uses a red bullseye as its logo) they said they were not an authorized retailer and Ring would not honor the cameras' warranties.

After more complaining, I was put in touch with a supervisor who said Ring was aware of the issue with the cameras and that they are working on a fix. I was offered 3 months of their cloud service so I can see videos when live view doesn't work. But this doesn't fix the problem of the motion sensor not triggering. So basically I spent $400 on cameras that sit in a drawer. I hope others can learn from my unfortunate experience with Ring and not make the same mistake.",1,0.3338,Positive,309
2165,The other day I had someone enter my house my front cameras picked it it but my stick up cam in the living room and my bedroom motion never went off. The next cam that turn on was my safe camera. Last image I had was the person leaving my house. A complete failure of the cameras. I would say they are unreliable. They fail once that’s once to many. It was some wired glitch because when I got home in 30 mins all cameras picked me up when I was doing a walkthrough the house.,1,-0.7469,Negative,96

I was breastfeeding my baby around 2am when I noticed the blue light (recording/someone watching) come on... the scary part is my husband was sleeping in the other room and we are the only two with access. I immediately took out the battery as I was shaking from fear. After further research I found multiple articles where WiFi cameras get hacked. I ended up returning the camera and got a regular baby monitor. I do not feel safe with these cameras inside my home where hackers can see and hear everything. I feel so violated and was scared to be in my own home.",1,-0.9393,Negative,149
2167,I do not understand why people are complaining. It works exactly as described. Ring never said it would operate the moment the box opened. It does take a little effort; maybe 5 or 7 min. I did have to use a latter to install one of the cameras so I expected maybe 3 minutes longer on that device. If you are unable to get out of a chair this device is not for you. The descriptions clearly say most devices take batteries and that means they do not last forever. If you want a camera that does not require you to change batteries then you need to get a wired device. I am electronically challenged and had no difficulty installing the camera and lights. Climbing the latter was the hardest part.,5,0.4284,Positive,131
2168,"Have had my Ring stick up cams for about a year now, which joined my Ring door bell pro. The battery life is quite good among my 3 Ring stickup cams. I bought a spare battery that I keep charged and ready to replace when I get a notification that battery is low in one of the cams. There is plenty of time to replace it before it's drained. I did have to upgrade my wifi router to a MESH wifi system to get coverage to all parts of the home for the cams to work. Depending on where you mount your cams, wifi signal may be a problem. The battery version of the cam is not as functional but far more versatile in terms of mounting and you are not limited to where you get power. You will have to factor in the $10/month for Ring Protect cloud recording. The app works well, and is all-in -one for Ring camera and security products.

The reliability is high and so is the picture quality. Also, the motion detection is scalable and is a noticeable improvement over my Amcrest cameras that have false alarms all the time.

All in all, a great system. My only wish is that the $10 service plan for the cloud storage was cheaper or maybe even free with Amazon Prime since Ring is owned by Amazon.

EDIT: bought a new Ring stick up camera. The mount is not as versatile. Also seems the wifi connection is not as good because I had problems setting it up. Ended up moving one of my ""pucks"" of my wifi mesh router to get a better signal.",4,0.9793,Positive,277

This wired Gen 3 cam is the same hardware as the battery powered Gen 2 & 3, except it comes with an AC power supply instead of battery.

These stickup cams which operate on the same battery last about a week if I'm lucky, less if motion alerts are on.

Ring chose to change the motion detection selection in this model by using a slide button which puts a blue haze over your coverage field but it only gives you motion coverage for the lower half of the screen. So what is viewed in the top half will not trigger an alert. This is ok if you only have a distance of about 30 feet to cover but terrible if you want back yard coverage. Seriously Ring, what are you thinking? This will go back in the box and returned and I will have to seek another manufacturer. I can not recommend.

Every mode allows you to customize the actions of each camera. For example, for Away mode all cameras are on and recording however for Home mode only the downstairs record while the upstairs cameras are off. Two things that are keeping this from being 5 stars:
1. Multiple issues with the initial setup - failed connections and camera stuck in updating mode. I found a way to resolve this however should not be this complicated. Hopefully a future update will resolve.
2. Cameras with low motion triggers that are supposed to be off based on mode are randomly triggered by motion and record. This has not happened in about a week now so might have already been resolved.

Great customer service is why I purchase Ring products - following my review I immediately received an email and regular followups to check on how things are going. Also, this camera is not advertised accordingly but you can purchase a batter pack to make the wired model work with both an outlet and/or backup battery.

Original Review: I’m a little disappointed with this. I’ve owned the doorbell since it first came out and have the Ring alarm system. Ring has by far one of the best customer service teams and overall good products. I initially was using Amazon cloud cams and rather than having to pay 2 monthly fees I decided to get one of these to test it out. The camera works great but the available features are horrible. I have this camera inside my home and I do not want it recording when I am home. The cloud cam would stop recording based on my location and has worked great. To switch this cam off I have to go into settings every single time. Ring needs to either enable location services based on/off or even Ring Alarm armed/disarmed modes to trigger the recording. Until this feature is enabled you will not have any privacy in your own home.",4,0.9268,Positive,356
2177,"I ordered these indoor cameras mainly for window coverage of areas where the outdoor cameras weren't able to see. Although these have limitations with motion detection through a window, there are a few workarounds that help significantly. You have to turn off the InfraRed motion detection to avoid the camera getting just it's reflection in the window. Also, the ""link"" feature is a life-saver. I have linked the front window camera to the doorbell camera, so that if the indoor camera doesn't pick up the motion (mostly happens at night), then the doorbell camera will trigger the window camera giving me more video coverage. This helps tremendously to catch a wider view. I have 3 of the indoor cameras, 2 in windows pointed outside and 1 in the garage. They are not ideally shaped for windows so they are a bit precarious and I'm looking into some stronger double sticky tape to make them a bit more stable. I don't mind pulling out the batteries to charge them, but they do seem to take an exorbitant amount of time to charge. I would have gotten the power cord ones, but that limits where you can put them. All in all, a good buy and I'm happy with the purchase.",3,0.9291,Positive,209

Then, we notice that the ""Live view"" times out after 5-10 minutes.

NOTE: that is not to say it disconnects from wifi. the feed is set to disconnect live view after 10 minutes and prmopt you to reconnect. a call to Ring.com support verified that this is the case and there is no way to diable the timeout.

This make using the camera as a baby monitor impossible as you need to hit reconnect every 5-10 minutes to keep viewing. Ring has said they will NOT fix the issue.

The only way I could get the doorbell to reconnect was by unplugging the stick up cam. I even set up a separate wifi network, specifically for the stick up cam, but it still refused to maintain a connection between both devices and the app. So that's it for me, sorry Ring.

Biggest issue is that these cameras have a difficult time running properly due to problems getting a strong wifi connection and drop offs in wifi connections! And, according to our numerous live chats with tech support, they need to be within 20 feet of your router to work properly. If they don't work properly, be prepared for many hours on Live Chat trying to figure things out...and then they will tell you to purchase one of their Chime Pros to extend your wifi so the cameras work better. We tried that and it had no effect. Then the rep on Live Chat tried to sell another one of their products ( a mesh network router) for $299 to make their cameras work better. It's ridiculous.

2183,"First of all I didn't purchase this from this vendor so don't blame them for a marginal product. The camera works pretty well unless you need it in a shady area with a sunlit background like a front porch with an overhang. There is no adjustment to lighting levels so during a high contrast situation like that all of the images are hard to make out who is in the picture unless you are familiar with the person. There is a slick way to control where the camera looks for motion so that it doesn't go off every time a car goes down the street, etc.. It also seems to have a nice infrared lighting capability for night shots that actually illuminate people to a more recognizable picture than during the bright sunlight. The rechargeable battery seems to work well. So far it's been a month+ and it still is holding charge.
I guess my biggest gripe is for you to have full recording capability you have to pay a monthly fee $$$. It makes it more slick but that is the ""Gotcha!"" angle that makes this device a no purchase item. I've seen where some other cameras have a slot to put a memory chip in to record triggered events.

Internet speeds are fine, RSS at 43 but still multiple attempts at trying to connect to camera for live feed. These are um, what is the word, novelties at best. Expensive novelties that sometimes catch the occasional car going by or a skunk in the night, but the gap between detection and recording is too long, and the 30 second recording time is not long enough.

I did my research and selected ring. Did research on each product, and pricing both up front and long term, and felt good about it. Especially the camera.

What I didnt realize in selecting several different parts of over $700 in equipment (Alarm base system kit, 2 indoor cameras and 4 outdoor cameras) was that ring had removed several features from an ""older"" version of the camera I was looking at (Now being marketed as the Stick up pro for twice the price) that I was counting on the in reviews I was watching on ring products. (Power via Ethernet, custom motion sensing zones) Never did I think watching the reviews that ring would release a ""new"" version of this product that was entirely stripped down. A oversight on my part for sure, but I really think they should have done something better than this shady naming scheme. Like calling this the ""stick up cam outdoor lite"" rather than the 3rd generation, which implies something better, while taking the old model and branding it as the ""elite""

Overall its DECENT and serviceable, but I really feel somewhat screwed by what I think is an intentionally confusing naming scheme. And I don't really have the money to correct my mistake so Im stuck with something that only half-works like I need it to.",1,0.8133,Positive,255
2191,"I've had mine for 3 months. Quality of video and motion detection is fine. But battery life is not good. I now have to charge the batter every 24-48 hours. I've done research and realized it's likely due to the camera being in a place that catches a lot of movement (indoors, covering kitchen/living room and both entry doors (front and back)). This is upsetting now that I've realized Ring sells a product that claims 3-6 months of battery life, but that battery life is only if the camera isn't in use/doesn't capture any movement...

UPDATE: I spoke with customer support and they confirmed the problem is that the camera is placed in an area with high traffic and it would be better if I moved it elsewhere, or reduced the sensitivity so it won't capture as much. I previously had it on a lower sensitivity and it completely missed someone walking by it at night. Their suggestion was to reset the camera and then continue testing it. (just what I want to do, spend more time than the 2-hours per week I already spend on the phone w/Ring). Just to be clear, Ring confirms battery operated cameras will not last more than 24-48 hours if you intend them to capture much activity on them. If there's very very little activity, the battery can last 5-6 months.

***UPDATE: warning about returning items with Ring devices. They won’t refund you until you send it back AND THEN you need to call to ask for the refund.

After connecting all 3 cameras I found one of them refused to give any sound. No alarm, no talking through it. Returned and replaced to give another shot.

After several weeks of having this camera I was not impressed. First, during the holiday season shipping carriers come and go. I had 2 different carrier vehicles parked in my driveway at different times/days and for some odd reason when I viewed live THEY WEREN'T THERE. I double checked ""my history"" lining up the exact time and the vehicles were not within the image at all. How misleading to think you're checking on your property and you aren't seeing something that is clearly within view. I reviewed the footage for that whole hour and the vehicles nor people still never appeared.

Motion Detection: Worked amazing at first and then it went to crap. Several times I wouldn't get notifications regarding motion until the person was at my door or leaving. I have a 200 foot driveway with the detection zone well within that. Absolutely no reason why I shouldn't have been notified. Would not appear in the ""my history"" section acknowledging motion detection either. Since I also had a camera in my backyard I tried it out myself and sometimes there was no motion detection at all. Motion detection with night vision was even worse.

WIFI Signal/Connection: After the first few days having the cameras working I stopped having issues with my signal/connection. I also used the Rapid Ring app which allowed me to view live much quicker.

I would not recommend this camera at all. I just do not think the camera works 24/7 as it should. These cameras made me believe several times no one was on my property but that was otherwise. I believe snapshots are taken and the camera keeps recording that to make it easier.",1,0.0344,Neutral,353

Still would not work. Every time I call Ring support, they say that it is a poor internet connection and are no help at all.

Guess what, still not enough wifi signal to appease the Ring devices. Every other device on my home network performs flawlessly, except for the Ring products.

These have been the worst investment I have ever made. I wish I would have just gone with a POE wired product from Swann or some other reputable security company.

The second photo is the same deer after they have moved into the back yard, and you can barely make out the deer less than 10 feet from the camera.

Without the monthly subscription, the camera is JUST A HANDS-FREE DOORBELL WITHOUT A PEEP HOLE.

Additionally, the camera has a short battery life. The device detection settings were at only 75% sensitivity with Motion Verification “on”. The battery only lasted only two weeks. It takes overnight to charge which means that your camera is out of service for one full day every two weeks unless you buy a second battery for $40. Also, with frequent battery changes, the device has to be located in a spot convenient to access. That means it is also convenient to vandalize or steal.

As a result, I opted to order the Ring Solar panels for my 2 stick up battery cams. Since installing the solar panels the power ranges from 99% to 100% all the time.

The color kept changing from a pink tint to a blue tint. Iva already had to unplug it and plug it again to get the color back to normal . The siren on the camera does not work . So if the burglar comes back , I can’t even cur the siren on . It takes FOREVER to connect , so if I get a motion detection , whatever was there is already gone!

I would recommend users get a network monitoring app so u can see how often these things fall off of your network. I was shocked, almost feel like it can miss up to 40% of motion events that you want to see because of the battery saving throttling every damn capability of the camera. I am constantly babying my system and it still misses things and will just refuse to give live views or timely notifications. I do not recommend the battery version.

2240,"1 year later 11/26/2020
I would highly NOT recommend ring cameras after a years use... period. After tweaking the sensitivity settings the batteries last ... maybe 3 weeks tops... which is very disappointing. All the issues noted below in original comment still are true after a years worth of trying to make it work.

The ring doorbell... again still not happy after a year. Doorbell itself does not reliably activate the indoor standard doorbell, even after changing transformer, and checking voltage, working with ring support. Monitoring through the ring doorbell has such a delay that I most often miss seeing whatever activated the monitoring area. Which is its entire purpose

I am not normally a negative Ned kind a customer but both the ring cameras and the ring doorbell have been such a disappointment in performance, features, and delivering what is marketed I felt the need to let the public know this and recommend them stay away. It’s very tempting while at Costco to see these devices on sale but know they are in my opinion an extreme waste of money. I would be willing to pay 2-3x for something that performs but this is not it. Will be removing all ring devices from my home.

Original Post: 2019
Bought a 3-pack of these from Sams club and put them up the next day.

Pros:
1. IOS app is nice as I already had a ring doorbell and the 3 cameras joined the existing app with very little effort. Setup and mounting was very straight forward.

2. During the day the units picture and live view features work great.

Cons:
1. Stickup cams have three motion sensing zones (left, middle, right) that you can enable/disable but does not allow creating a custom zone shape as is available on the ring doorbell. So that inflexibility was a big disappointment as it never dawned on me the same manufacturer would change this between so similar products. The ability to construct and position your own motion sensing areas is available in the ring doorbell but NOT in the ring stickup cams.

2. Battery life is very poor. I have one camera at the front of my driveway overlooking my two cars in the driveway as there has been some car breakins in my neighborhood that I wanted to be able to detect the unwanted guests. The documentation states the batteries should be good for 3-6 months... I am seeing about 3 weeks before I have to break out the ladder shimmy up there to get the battery, recharge it, then again up the ladder to replace it. Not cool and the specifications are very misleading regarding the battery duration as the activity that is seen in my driveway is not that frequent. Which leads to my next point below, motion detection distance.

3. I have the camera mounted on the peak of my garage under the overhang to protect the unit a bit from rain and heavy direct sunlight as I was hoping to have these units for along time. The motion detection range is only 30', and this is admittedly my fault for not noticing this before purchase, so my bad. The purpose of this unit was to capture anyone messing around my truck and/or my wife's car while in the driveway at night. The motion detection covers only the very front of the vehicle so it's basically useless in the function I had in mind. Ugg...

4. And the last point is night vision not being very clear or having the ability to zoom. In live view you can see there is something/someone out there but cannot distinguish any level of detail that would be beneficial in determining who the individual or creator is.

5. There is no object recognition. I have heard from some friends at work that have very inexpensive wyze cameras that this $30 unit captures pics locally to sd card, no reoccurring fees, has tracking mechanism once motion is detected, and will detect type of object. Again Ring a disappointment from ring as a solution.

6. The last item I have issue with is the ring doorbell that I have. I have it wired to the normal doorbell that I had at the house. I installed the ring doorbell unit but the actual doorbell that ""ding dongs"" did not function. Based on Ring support replaced the transformer for the door bell and still the door bell ""ding dong"" does not function. I went out and bought a new doorbell ""ding dong"" unit that makes the noise. Now all I get is a buzz for ~ 10 secs and a ""dong"". Wife is not happy.

Summary:
In all I suppose the ring stick up cams would be fine indoors if they were plugged into a power source. Overall satisfaction with the ring product support desk has been good experience as they did a good job working with me trying to get the ring doorbell to work correctly so the support organization is good. The actual products I would rate at about 2 stars or C-, not very good for the price, not very reliable, I intend to spend some time looking for an overall solution to replace both doorbell and external security camera system.",2,0.9674,Positive,876
2241,"Took a while to actually get set up, but that could be my network. Now that the Stick Up Cam is active it is slow to respond to motion. Once motion is detected the video is stagnant, sometimes freezes and becomes pixelated. Lastly, on a number of occasions, I've noticed that the lens is blurred due to mist or whatever. It usually clears after a few hours.",2,0.6486,Positive,67
2242,"I bought this camera for outdoor use and it worked great using the 30-day free recording plan. Once the 30 day period was up the camera would no longer connect to the network. The folks at Ring said it was my internet connection strength. As an experiment, I then purchased the basic protection plan. The camera worked great again. Don't be fooled by the thinking the camera will work without one of the recording plans. The company must have some settings that mess with the connection if you don't have a plan.",3,0.9214,Positive,92
2243,"I'm changing my review based purely on Ring's customer service.

We bought two of these for our house as a 'puppy cam.' Our needs our minimal, we don't want motion detection (the dog walks around a lot), we don't need motion notifications. Literally all we need is to be able to activate live view when we're not home to see what pup is doing. We installed the cameras with no problems. Upon installation, when we try the live view, it just spins on the 'activating camera' message and then times out with 'live view ended' (without ever showing a live view) or a streaming error.

The RSSI for each is -39 and -34. We have full wifi signal on our iPhones. We have a Ruckus Access Point (within line of site and about 20 feet away from both cameras - what can I say, it's a small house). Our internet speed is well above the minimum specifications for the cameras.

I will be buying two more for the front yard next.",5,0.7947,Positive,87
2276,Setting up and installing the ring stick up camera was very easy. I have purchased the solar panel to keep the battery charged. I had originally thought something was wrong with the battery because it kept dying. It was because it was set up in the app as being wired not battery operated. After that was adjusted I have not had any problems. The solar panel has been keeping they camera charged. Highly recommend this camera!,5,0.4284,Positive,76
2277,"Love these cameras. Great picture quality. The changes in the software now allow customization of the zones, other than the security that the cameras provide, this is my favorite function.

2278,Easy install. Battery took HOURS to charge but it lasts. My only issue is that it didn't work very well in 39 degree cold in California. I had to go outside and while it down to get a clear photo. Is that supposed to happen? We have 3 other stick up cams (White) that never fog up.,4,0.4222,Positive,57
2279,I have a ring doorbell and a chime (both hardwired). Received 2 stick up cams for Christmas. Installed today. Since they run off of battery I logged into the app to check it out. They were both listed at 24% !!!!! Not happy currently. Awaiting customer services response. That is awful like beyond awful for a $40 battery. If it doesn’t improve or get fixed I’ll be returning.,3,-0.6971,Negative,68
2280,This camera is for an outside mount. The picture is great and the motion detection is one reason we purchased this model. We added the solar charger and the camera health option tells us the battery is charged virtually all the time through the wifi connection.,5,0.5106,Positive,46
2281,"Sadly, I have to keep popping the battery to reboot this camera every other day. And the video is jerky.

I did not mount it, I held it in my hand, tried every possible direction, with and without lights on and unless the subject was within 6 feet you could not see it. I could not see my driveway with 2 cars in it at 25 feet away. What a big disappointment. I would never recommend my current Uniden system to anybody but that was actually 100x better in the night than this.",1,-0.3105,Negative,101

So I decided to add another cheaper camera ( stickup batery) to the mix from a local store,, except this camera would not complete the setup no matter what I did. Mind you nothing changed in my wireless setup since the setup of the first 2 cameras so this camera should have just setup with no problem. I tried everything and again backwards (could go in more detail, but want to keep this short) because I really wanted this cam to work. I go so frustrated with it that not only did I return it after having wasted hours of my time trying to make it connect but I have also put a firm hold off on buying any more ring cams.

2287,With these plug in models I don't need to keep changing batteries. But I get error messages that the battery level is low even though it is a plug in model. This error can affect your camera usage. If you pay even more money and buy a battery it will help but my opinion is that you shouldn't need a battery because it has constant power from the outlet it's plugged into.,3,-0.8145,Negative,72
2288,"the recording time is limited to 20 seconds, that is ridiculous for recording outside. There is absolutely no good reason for such a small limit for a wired camera.

Having to connect the longer outdoor cable makes you have to cut a Big, huge hole in the wall in order to connect the power on the inside of your home. This is a dumb idea. Why not have one long barrel cable which makes it much simpler to plug in on the inside of your home.",1,-0.4767,Negative,75
2293,I purchased this stickup cam with the solar panel for our remote mail box to monitor traffic on our short dead end street. I selected it based on the good performance we've had with the Ring Doorbell. I'm disappointed with the quality of the camera. We cannot read the license plate numbers as they are blurry from 10 feet away. Hope you can engineer a better camera performance.,2,-0.0258,Neutral,68

2296,We have six Ring cameras. We bought four over a year ago and liked them very much. So we ordered two more a couple of months ago. We were very disappointed with the new ones. The construction and design have changed. It is not as well made and attaching it outside is not as flexible. Most important however is the fact that the video quality is much worse. I doubt it is 1080P anymore and the width of the viewing angle is narrower. Overall is it a much poorer quality product. If image quality matters to you don't buy this product. Ring is obviously sourcing them from a different company in China and the poorer quality really shows.,1,-0.888,Negative,118
2297,"I am amending a previous negative review because I was contacted by a RING representative to help me with my issue. I appreciate good customer service.

PROS:
Camera does what it is advertised to do. I have one outside and one inside. The app is very easy to use and the cameras were easy to install and set up.

CONS
I have two of the Ring Stick Up Cams. For one of them, the battery was VERY difficult to change and was stuck inside, but eventually I managed to get it out by using a small screw driver to pry it out. (My second camera is very easy to change the battery).",4,0.7409,Positive,112

2303,"Don't bother with this camera, it is limited to only 10 minutes of live view. A basic feature for almost all security cameras. With Ring cameras, if you wanted to use this camera to view a camera for more than 10 minutes, you have to press a button every 10 minutes because it stops viewing after 10 minutes due to a needless restriction. You also can view only 1 of the cameras at a time in real time.",1,-0.1135,Negative,78
2304,"I will find a use for this camera at some point or figure out how to make the wifi signal better, but I expected more from Ring. I have the security system and it has been great.

The RSS signal strength indicator is confusing or meaningless...I don't know which.",2,0.946,Positive,67
2305,"Got this for a Christmas gift, so far works great and only took 15 minutes to fully setup.

The new update integrates everything into the app quite well highly recommend this camera!",5,0.9413,Positive,61
2306,Videos are clear unless you zoom in to much. Would like a little less delay between time motion is detected until you hear alert on phone. I don't like the fact that if you go to live view to soon after an alert you will get no recording. So you have to wait after an alert or you lose all evidence that anything happened.,4,0.4518,Positive,64

I have a Ring security system that consists of the base station, door sensors, motion sensors etc. In this system, when say, someone opens a door (that has a door sensor), the base station ""chirps"" (I can customize alerts on each sensor). It would really be nice if I could integrate alerts into my base station..Maybe it exists and I missed it.

Other than that, I was able to install the stick-up cam outdoors very quickly and get it working. Monitoring the rate of battery usage, it seems that it might last me about 60 days with a full charge.. which is OK with me.",3,0.8403,Positive,120
2312,"Mostly satisfied until the trial service but
after trial, it’s not working with my Echo show. I don’t need recording, I’m using this device just for live cam but it’s not connecting at all. Which is strange cuz I still can see with the application.
And I didn’t know I should pay additional payment for Ring Protect service which you can record and share. I have Wyze cam, much cheaper and is able to rotate and record for FREE. I choose Ring only because it’s for outdoor use, if I knew there is an extra pay monthly, I wouldn’t choose this device. And the worst thing is it was hard to reach the customer service.

I would recommend this Ring Cam to a friend and in fact I liked it so much, I purchased a second!",5,0.9652,Positive,71
2314,Motion sensor is kind of useless. It detects the sun light as motion kind of ridiculous. Because of that the battery life is worst than I thought it would be. If it didn’t consider sunlight as motion the battery life would last a lot longer due to the fact there’s rarely motion on that side of the house.,3,-0.8746,Negative,58

Its just an arc you can adjust larger or smaller. Also when it starts recording it does not go back a few moments before motion and only records like a 30 second clip at a time.

2387,You cant see anything that happened in the past or record anything unless you pay Ring a monthly subscription fee. Total rip off and a stupid gimmick way of pricing. Don’t buy this.

2586,"The zones for motion detection are left, right and center but they are not adjustable for distance. So unless you can tilt the camera down far enough, things that you would like to ignore, such as pedestrians just passing by will trigger the motion sensor and send out unnecessary alerts. So the pivot is too limited to do that. If it could do that, then you could lose the view of the action that passes by when the camera has been triggered by motion. You might not be able to see a car service or taxi that you ordered.

The night vision is pretty good with the infrared. If big nearby objects are in the view and reflecting the light back to the camera, then the camera is blinded because it functionally drops the aperture and darkens the intruder's face.

The wifi seems pretty good but it may be necessary to use wifi extenders or have a mesh system to optimize the upload speed to get a better image that doesn't pixelate because of fast motion. This is hard to test except with lab conditions. Sometimes people in view seem to freeze for an annoying period of important time when they might otherwise be presenting their best face during the freeze period. The units probably can't buffer enough data to deal with slow connections.

My view with limited experience dealing with this kind of stuff.",4,0.978,Positive,235
2587,Awesome camera! My wife and I wanted one to monitor the house while we are away at work and we have peace of mind knowing that it detects any slight motion for us. It alerts us and we can see what caused the camera to go off. A great buy for the home.,5,0.9184,Positive,53
2588,"We love our Ring camera, it makes us feel so much safer. The app is great amd easy to use and it was very simple to set up and install.

Definitely purchase an extra battery pack as well so that you can get the most out of your camera!",5,0.966,Positive,76
2589,"A big selling point of Ring Stick up Cam is that it can be both indoor and outdoor, which is also the difference between it and Spotlight Cam.

The minimum temperature tolerance is only 5°F, which is quite different from Spotlight Cam's -22°F.",5,0.9393,Positive,85

2607,This is a great camera. You'll still have to purchase a Amazon ring plan once the free trial is over,5,0.8442,Positive,20
2608,"Great Camera! Great Value when all things considered.

Let’s address some people’s gripes first. You CAN use the camera without subscription but it is limited. For $3/mo per camera or $10/mo for ring protect (all devices) this gives you full access to cloud recording. That’s a steal, stop being cheap and stop complaining. Could it have local storage sure but it doesn’t. Should it give you more than 24 hrs at minimum to look back on your events ? Sure but it doesn’t.

Another gripe I read is that it does not integrate with ring alarm. This is False. It DOES integrate with the ring alarm under “linked devices”. It may not have full integration but I’m almost certain it’s in the pipeline. Ring is constantly evolving and pushing updates.

As for the camera pros, well at $100 it’s a great value. Their battery operated versions always have a different motion zone setup but I’ll take it. I understand the battery and wired versions have to run different Software/Firmware due to power usage/constraints. It’s got decent field of view, great night vision, motion detection and picture quality. It really is a great camera. If you’re familiar with the previous stickup cam it is very similar with some minor changes. The biggest physical change is the mount which still works great for table and wall mount.

Aside from that, rings customer service in my experience is pretty good. If your at all into the ring ecosystem definitely consider this $100 camera. One Major Miss is the lack of Homekit and Apple Watch integration.",4,0.9903,Positive,262
2609,"This product has a good gimmick. However, if you are using this for more than a novelty door bell(security) then it is a giant waste of money. The service plan is the only way to have videos recorded. More than half the time the service plan doesn’t work, or they have a hiccup. Trying to talk to their customer service is one of the most painful things I have ever had to do.

5 times in 2 years I have had problems with the service plan. The last time I had a problem with my ring products(chime, doorbell pro, spotlight camera, solar charger, stick up cam), I called ring support and they assured me it was fixed. The next day someone stole my truck, trailer, and equipment from the front of my house. There was a motion event(5 of them in the 2 hour time frame my truck was stolen) on the app. But I could not access it, mind you I have a subscription paid in full for 10 more months. Ask customer service to retrieve the video for me. They said no we can not because your account has an error. We will fix this error for you and you will be good. I said how good are we talking, new truck, trailer, and gear kinda good? Or knowing who stole my stuff good? They said no just your device will work good.

Don’t by ring products. Arlo performs way better, even the cheaper brands allow you to do more with them and have free recording.",1,0.9353,Positive,258
2610,"Please Read...When purchased, the device comes with one battery and a USB port to charge with NO charging box. Ring stated on the website there is no issue with plugging into computer. About 5 minutes in charging the brand new ring battery, the ring battery blows up my PC. Been back and forth with ring to compensate for a defective battery and for damaging my PC that has ran fine for years. Ring procrastinated and said that they will only compensate the order but if their defective product destroys your property then that’s still the consumers loss. Please do not believe that they are on the consumers side because of the fine print in their terms and conditions.",1,-0.9035,Negative,118
2611,I cannot recommend the battery version of this camera. Buy the solar or plug in. Battery only lasts for a week before requiring a charge. Previous Ring camera (original stick up cam) would last for at least a month. Disappointed in my choice.,2,-0.4423,Negative,43
2612,"So, I don't regret this but there are things to be aware of. First, it has decent picture quality, battery life and motion detection but doesn't really excel at any of these. Sometimes there's a 20 second delay before the motion alert detects on my phone or watch. The ""people only"" mode doesn't work, a cat or squirrel will still trigger it. I had planned to put this inside on the window ledge looking out at the doors. But, the night vision or motion detection don't work through the window. The swivel mount has a very limited range of motion so it took some creativity to get it pointed right. But, all in all I like having the cameras and these are a good value for the money.",4,0.8829,Positive,128
2613,Easy setup,5,0.4404,Positive,2
2614,"This Ring Stick Up Cam gets the job done but there are a few notable flaws that are worth mentioning.

Ring released this new generation of the Stick Up Cam in October 2019. I pre-ordered it and got it on the first day it came out. I like the fact they lowered the price to $100 vs. the $180 the 2nd generation stick up cam cost. Although, along with lowering the price, they did remove some features that were in the 2nd generation. No POE (Power over Ethernet) which provided a more stable connection than Wi-Fi, no siren, and smaller field of view (110° horizontal, 57° vertical on this camera) vs. 2nd generation's 150° horizontal, 85° vertical.

All of those omissions aren't too bad and I don't mind too much. I don't use Ring Alarm so I can't speak on that negative aspect some of the other reviews mentioned. I also don't understand why people are so mad about a subscription being required to view your recordings (after the initial 30-day free trial), it states in the product description for this product and also on the box if you pick it up in store, that a subscription is required after 30 days to view past recordings. It even lists the prices for the subsciption ($3/month or $30/year for one Ring camera or $10/month or $100 year for unlimited multiple cameras at one household). This is a lot better deal than something like the Google Nest Cameras which charge $10-$30/month PER CAMERA.

The camera is good and mostly gets the job done, but there are a few things that I can't get past.

---Notifications Are Not Reliable: I mean, c'mon, I need to be notified when there is motion. There were some times where I would walk right up to the camera and it would trigger a notification until I had I already gotten right up to it. This is even with the motion settings set to include a wide area in front of the camera. This is such a massive flaw. I'd say it happens about 20% of the time. Unacceptable.

---Wi-Fi range is horrible: This camera's ability the pick up a Wi-Fi signal, even when the router is close by, is horrible. I don't have a large house. It's a single story 1600 sq ft. place with 50mpbs download internet speed/13mbps upload (way more than the 2mpbs upload speed Ring recommends). I put a Wi-Fi extender in the middle of my house, about 15 feet away from the outside where the Ring stick up cam is mounted. And the camera STILL struggles to connect to the Wi-Fi a few to many times.

---The Lag Time Between Motion Notification and Being Able to Open & See It: I get a motion notification on my phone. I click on notification to see what the camera picked up....and it just buffers, then gives an error message stating it cannot be done. I usually have to wait about 5 minutes AFTER a notification before I'm successfully able to view it.

---No Night Vision: It didn't mention night vision in the product description, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it still is disheartening to have a camera advertised as a security camera...that is only really useful during the day. When do burglars and robbers usually strike? During the night. At night, the camera can really only pick up a face when it gets RIGHT UP to the camera. Anything else and it's a blurry mess.

Overall, decent camera with some notable flaws.

Update 5/23/2020:
Camera completely stopped working. For about one week leading up to it's shut down, notifications had been unreliable. Both Ring app and the camera have been very buggy and hard to use.",1,-0.9024,Negative,624
