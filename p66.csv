0,"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.

I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.

The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.

You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.

All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.

A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.

Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!

And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.

Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!

UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!",5,0.9989,Positive,771
1,"Disclaimer: this is not my first Echo device - I have altogether 5 of them at the moment, and have used them for at least 3 years.

Unlike other reviewer who criticized this gadget, I had no problems with setting it up and with using it. It works fine, plays music and answers questions. I am just unhappy with the sound, that was, of course, the primary reason to upgrade from Echo Plus to this device.

The good:
a. Bass is better that on my Echo Plus.

The bad:
a. Trebles are very bad and muddy. Rudimentary equalizer settings (Bass, Midrange, Treble) are not sufficient to adjust the sound properly. I believe the problem is mostly due to phase cancellation effect on a single tweeter that mixes signal from left and right channels. Amazon developers, please consider either adding another tweeter in the next generation, or employing a better algorithm that will minimize phase cancellation effect.
b. The switch for ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"", that is enabled by default, makes the sound much worse and completely kills the trebles.
c. There is a clear dis-balance in volume between spoken voice (that appears too quiet) and music (too loud). So every time you use it, you need to adjust the volume.
d. Light ring that shows that Alexa is listening for you can be seen only from above, and not from the side, so if you ask Alexa to do something from 3 steps away, you don't know if it can hear you or not.",2,-0.5897,Negative,253
2,"After installing the update (that took an hour) it still won't consistently play music. I don't know if this device is ready for primetime as this seems like a common issue.

I was very excited for this one as I use my original echo daily to listen to the radio or music. Little difference between this device and the original when it comes to listening to talk radio like NPR or news streaming. The music that it did play sounded better than the original echo (much of the difference was an increase of bass). It sounded good when it played music.

I have returned it because of the inconsistency and lack of functionality. I opted to not get a replacement though because I have my echo spot hooked up to a Boston Acoustics speaker that sounds as good and it's cheaper than the $200 For this speaker.

Having used this ""studio"" version, I would recommend hooking up your old Alexa to a quality speaker instead of spending the money on this one. I find this to be a much more versatile option. Plus this thing is huge and didn't fit in the place where my original echo sits.

My experience with Amazon customer service this time was horrible! I talked with about 15 different representatives to arrange for a ups pickup for the defective one and now I need to contact ups and try to accomplish this. Seems like Amazons policies or customer service has taken a nosedive.",1,0.9823,Positive,248
3,"I am very pleasantly surprised. I have an Echo Plus which I thought sounded good (but it's mono). I'm a big-time audiophile. My home theater subwoofer is a Velodyne SPL-1200 II (1000 Watt with a 12"" Kevlar cone), my main speakers are hand made with RAAL electrostatic ribbon tweeters and solid bamboo cabinets - five identical. Point being, I enjoy good sound and I have a very picky ear. I like full range clarity and balance. More than anything, I'm tired of wires at my home computer workstation, I've tried so hard to simplify things. My Bose Companion 20's are incredible but they're cumbersome, top-heavy and require way too much wiring.

Problem is, no single speaker I've tried has had the sound-stage two or more speakers can have. So I decided to try this... Awesome Amazon. Incredible. The Dolby Atmos actually sounds like I am sitting in front of two speakers (or more). I had to move it around a little bit to find a sweet spot but it is so nice. Frank Sinatra sounds like he's in the room. The bass is full without distortion unless you crank the volume all the way, the clarity is there. The unit is heavy and substantial. I'll be enjoying this for both my computer content and yours as I have the Dot, Alexa, and Echo Plus.",5,0.9939,Positive,224
4,"I had a Sonos beam and sub combo that cost $1,200 and it sounded great but I was never happy with it not being able to be a part of the multi room audio with all of my other echo speakers. I was hoping the Studio might be close enough in sound quality that I could replace Sonos. I purchased two Studios and a sub it has definitely surpassed my expectations. Goodbye Sonos! I feel like our living room is the closest we can get to a movie theater experience without spending thousands of dollars and you can get it all for a little over $500. Sonos is definitely clear and loud but I feel the Atmos and 3D Music add a depth to the sound that the Sonos is missing. It's like a whole new experience watching Jack Ryan with these running Atmos...so good!

I didn't have any issues adding the Studios/Sub to a Home Theater group to my Fire TV. All you have to do is make sure the Fire TV and Studios all have the latest firmware. You can check in the Fire TV menu and you can ask the Studios to update the software. I even like how when you increase volume the Fire TV cube and both Studios Alexa indicators light up so you can tell how much you are increasing/decreasing volume.

Amazon has always provided a great value for their good products at a good price but I feel they have exceeded expectations with the Studio. This is definitely an awesome product for an awesome price!",5,0.9949,Positive,262
5,"UPDATE 11/21/19 - I received a replacement unit on 11/13. I set it up and everything seems to be working. I would note that for whatever reason the packaging of the replacement was more generic than what I originally got (the box didn't have the picture of the device on it, just was plain black) and it didn't come with the power cord which I had sent back with the defective unit. I don't care about the box at all but why not supply the power cord??? (luckily for me I had a spare I could use from another device - it's just a generic figure 8 power cord). I did also pair the new device with an echo sub I used to have connected to a stereo pair of Gen 2 Echos. I like the sound from the studio and I definitely can hear the difference in 3D music vs. non-3D music. Interestingly now that it is paired with the sub I don't really notice the Studio being that much better than the stereo pair of Gen 2 echos (with sub) that I used before when playing non-3D music. Granted I'm no audiophile but I'm wondering if it was worth the upgrade when I already had the sub to help the Gen 2 Echos in the bass dept. I debated changing the rating since the replacement works as advertised and I think Amazon customer service was great (although after leaving the negative review below they called me within an hour or two - otherwise I had been waiting for a few days for follow-up), however the whole review/experience may get missed by others if I up the score so I'll leave as-is.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW 11/11/19:

I preordered this speaker the day after it was announced. With 8 existing Echos around the house I was more than excited to experience the sound quality from this HomePod killer. It arrived on launch day (11/7) and I immediately went to work setting it up. With baited breath I told Alexa to ""play the best of 3D music"" in order to get the full 3D experience and Alexa repeated my command as a confirmation. Then...... nothing. No music. No sound. Was the volume too low? No, it was set around 5/10. About 30-45 seconds after the initial command Alexa told me ""Sorry, I'm having trouble playing the music"".

Long story short I tried everything - playing different stations, playlists, individual songs, etc. All with the same result. Alexa would repeat my command as confirmation (just like the other Echos prior to playing what I asked) but then there was silence for anywhere from 15-45 seconds before she would tell me ""I'm having trouble playing the music"". I called tech support after running through all the online suggestions (reboot cable modem, reboot router, reset Echo, remove and reinstall Alexa app, etc.). Even though the Studio was in the same spot in my house where an existing Echo pair with Sub was located I put the Echo Studio 6 inches from the router and went through some more troubleshooting with the tech on the phone. I asked the Studio to update software and was told on several attempts ""Sorry, I experienced a problem, please try again later"".

To be clear the Echo does everything else it is supposed to - control lights, answer questions, play the news, etc. It just won't play music (and I'm an unlimited subscriber).

After an hour on the phone with the Amazon tech he was clueless. He pulled some logs to send to engineering team and I've yet to hear back. I REALLY wanted to love this new Echo and the sound quality but right now it's not even up to par with an Echo Dot - at least the Dot can play music.

I'm sure this will get sorted out somehow, either with some update or with the replacement of the device itself. It's just frustrating to wait so long for the preorder, get the device, and have it not work. And Amazon's Echo Studio page is saying it's out of stock until 12/10 so it may be another month before I can have the chance to hear music on a replacement. I hope others that got theirs on launch day didn't have the same experience!",1,0.9956,Positive,718
6,"Great upgrade for my open floorplan. I started with a dot and worked my way up until I had the previous top model (3"" woofer and .8"" tweeter) paired with the matching sub. While that pair was great across the spectrum, the soundstage was off due to the sub sitting against the wall, rather than next to the echo. I had reservations that the front firing tweeter on the Studio wouldn't disperse well from the center of the house, however that isn't an issue. The studio sits on my kitchen bar and points away from the kitchen. It does great at filling the central part of the house with music, including the kitchen ""behind"" it. Had I not done my research, I probably wouldn't have realized it had a front firing tweeter, vice up or down.
I moved the sub into the master bedroom where it's near that echo. This added the low end to the bedroom without the spatial blur of the sub sitting away from the mids/highs.
Back to the Studio... it delivers premium sound to the bulk of my first floor and now that the woofer is integrated into the echo, the soundstage is no longer off/annoying.

There has been a steady improvement in audio quality over the past several models and generations, now that the Studio delivers premium sound in a single package... I'm not sure where Amazon will go next. I'd buy a smaller future device IF it delivered equal sound quality. I am not interested in sacrificing range or depth for size though. The Studio fits fine on the bar and I can crank it up when the wife is out.

Considering the Studio is full range in a single device, I am very pleased with the pricing. If Amazon offers any holiday deals, you should definitely give in and upgrade to at least one studio. If no deals soon, give in and pay full price like I did. I think it's still a bargain at full price.

For comparison, downstairs I have the studio, a premium echo with sub paired, another premium, 1 echo in the garage, and dots in the kids' rooms. I guess towers will eventually work their way into the kids' rooms... upstairs I run Monitor Audio Silver 7.2 with SVS cylinder subs and I still have a dot hooked up to my receiver to listen to audio commands.

Well done Amazon. Oh, one final nod to incorporating a spectral automatic equalizer to immediately adjust the Studio's audio output to match it specifically to your room's configuration.",5,0.9586,Positive,427
7,"I got this unit to replace my old Bose SLII and it was an excellent decision; your get a decent bass and clear sound. I really liked some of the 3D sound songs available in Amazon HD, however not all of them are impressive. I also tried the extended stereo feature and it does a decent job in electronic music but it sound unnatural in acoustic/vocal songs.

I did not notice any difference between Spotify and Amazon music, I'm not 100% that the streaming was even HD because when I clicked in the icon Amazon Music app said that the information was not available. I don't rate down the speaker for this because is an Amazon HD problem, but just to make my point clear: this is not an audiophile grade speaker, it sounds very good but it doesn't reach the clarity I got from my M-Audio monitors.
In my humble opinion this speaker is a better option than Apple Homepod.",5,0.9504,Positive,161
8,"This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD.
For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.

I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.

In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.

If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.

Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.

Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.

This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.

So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.

The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.

Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!",3,0.9991,Positive,1372
9,"When this was anounced I was so excited, I thought I finally found the holy Grail of home theater. Get a pair of these, an echo sub, and a 4k FireTV edition tv. Let it all mate and be a beautiful compatible system that finally just works. No wires, Dolby atmos, what a joy it should be.

Well it doesn't work!

Basically its worthless for home theater use with Amazon's own Fire TV edition tv's

Can't connect wirelessly to FireTV edition as a home theatre in the app, as alexa app won't permit it, says not compatible.

So as work around, Bought a toslink to mini toslink cable and connected to Toshiba FireTV edition tv that way and it still stinks, you can't control the volume with the tv remote anymore, So i would need to buy another remote and give up the single remote which ruins the whole FireTV built into the tv all just works experience.

Didn't even get to the point of attempting to mate a second studio to the first to try and at least get 5.1 out of it (Amazon website, while totally unclear, seems to say the toslink input can NOT be shared anyway). Gotta go cancel my second order.

Even if pairing two does work, the second remote experience is probably a deal breaker. But the web is clear 3d and Dolby atmos wont pass over the toslink optical anyway. Just all around disappointing mess.

Epic fail that the most expensive top of the line echo speaker doesn't work with most expensive top of the line fire TV devices.

Totally bummed.

****Update 5 months later and still horrible. Acquired a 4k fire stick as a workaround. And the home theater experience is still terrible. If you pause, ff or rwd video and it loses synch. Frequently it disconnects and you have to reboot everything. Sometimes it disconnects and you have to remove it from the network. Terrible

Epic fail months later

Buy a sound bar or a real system for your home theater. Not this",1,-0.9845,Negative,342
10,"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.
There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.
Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.
The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.
The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.
So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.

UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.
As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.

Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.",5,0.9981,Positive,1065
11,This is by far the best sounding home assistant that is currently on the market. The microphones have been substantially improved so it can pick up your wake word even while the music is playing at a higher level. No more screaming at Alexa in this house!,5,0.8739,Positive,47
12,"I have been a Musician for over 35 years and play various Instruments very well. I am also an audiophile. I am pretty critical of AMAZON at times but I will honestly have to say that they really delivered with the ECHO STUDIO. It does sound very good. It only took a minute to gather the information for the best acoustics for my room and it does have a full sound. If you have it pre-registered to you set up is extremely easy. All you have to do is plug it in and wait just a minute while it connects to your WiFi network. I own 2 ECHO PLUS and a second gen ECHO that all still work like a champ incidentally after several years. This is absolutely an upgrade. Also had LED lighting that I installed with it and it was pretty easy as well. The only complaint that I have is so far after 3 trys I can't get it to find my 4K FIRESTICK remote in pairing mode when I ask the ECHO STUDIO to find it despite knowing how and following the instructions to the letter. I am hoping not to have to factory reset the FIRESTICK. Otherwise I am extremely pleased with this and plan on getting another one to pair with as well as the ECHO sub. As I stated previously I have been critical to some degree in the past with AMAZON but I earnestly mean every word of this review. In all likelihood you will be very happy with the ECHO STUDIO...
Update... I have since added another ECHO STUDIO and the ECHO SUB and after a couple of initial hiccups it all sounds great. Other than the fact that one is still announcing the Song and Artists while the other is beginning the Song I can't complain. There is no lag whatsoever it's only when the Song Title and Artist is being announced by Alexa that the other is already beginning the Song. I really do like this setup for my bedroom with my Unlimited Music plan that I have had for years with AMAZON. I also appreciate the new Ultra HD and 3D features that come with my Unlimited Family Music plan. They are not going to replace my really high end speakers but I am very pleased with these and would easily recommend this setup for anyone who Loves Music of All Genres...",5,0.9983,Positive,404
13,"My first review ever. I feel compelled to offset some of the one star reviews.

In short, well designed user friendly high quality product for the price.

Long version... I was disappointed with audio quality at first. Thought I might return them. Like others mentioned I noticed poor reproduction in the mids and highs even after running room correction. Was user error, important to remember speaker placement. I had my left speaker nearly against a wall and the room correction did what it could to compensate. When I moved it and did a factory reset and new room correction they sounded great.

Had to do another factory reset after I laid a folder on top of one while in use. (Would love to see a version with room correction app without factory reset.)

As you can see in the photo they are in competition with a pair of play 5’s. Bet you would like to know which is better. Honestly, neither. They are very different in their audio reproduction design. Both are very worthy of their price point. I did decide to add a sub to the studios after comparing them to the play 5’s. Good base on the studio’s but not up to the Sonos. The amazon sub could use a user selectable crossover app, but all in all a bargain at the price.

I switched from iTunes to amazon music several years ago. This recent purchase of the studios makes me even more pleased I did. I like the Sonos app a lot, but with amazon music I find myself saying “Alexa play some music”. She always plays something great tailored to my taste. She makes a better playlist than I could myself.

My favorite listening environment was B&O pentas or my B&O RL 60’s back when turntables and cd was the source. Now that we have repaired the damage done to music with mp3 and have brought room correction to everyone we are in a whole new era.

I can’t wait for the next step from amazon or Sonos. I believe at some point there will be floor standing speakers with room correction, matching amps for each driver and digital delay with room correcting software.

Stereo pair Sonos play 5’s $1,000
Stereo pair echo studios with echo sub $530. Love both. Use studios most of the time.

Amazon let me know when you build a pair of floor standing speakers. I’m in.",5,0.9939,Positive,405
14,"The Amazon Echo Studio is a one of a kind audio device with a unique sound you've likely never heard before from a standalone speaker.

Some thought and engineering was put into this product and it clearly shows with it's sound quality.

When I first played a song from the Studio I felt like I had speaker in every direction in my house; almost like being at a concert. To me it sounds better than a stereo pair. I can only imagine the sound quality when paired with a second Studio since one alone has already knocked my socks off.

The Echo Studio is by far the largest speaker Amazon has released but in the grand scheme it's quite small when compared with a 5.1 stereo
system which that's basically what you're getting here from one Echo Studio speaker with it's 5 mulidirectional internal speakers system.

I've read a few critiques about the aesthetics of the Studio with it's gray woven cloth but to me it looks just fine with it's minimalist design. But I didn't buy the Studio to look at, I bought it so I could hear the wonderful sound it emits.

Regarding the bass you can feel it in your chest and feet when played at higher volumes. it's somewhat of a perplexing experience because of the Studio's size. What wizardry is in this Echo? I don't know but I don't really care. It does what it does and does it well.

To sum things up, this is one superb audio device that truly delivers with immersive sound. If you buy the Echo Studio you will likely be highly impressed for what you're getting at the price point. The Amazon Echo Studio has likely paved the way for the next evolution of sound, who knows what the future holds.",5,0.989,Positive,302

16,"So I have an interesting review to write. I Purchased my first echo studio from Best Buy and immediately got it home and playing music. I was immediately underwhelmed by the music that was coming out of the speaker and was confused. I had heard so many good reviews and how much people love this speaker. Was I just too much of an audio snob to appreciate it or was I doing something wrong. I repaired the speaker just in case I had messed something up in the set up process and it still didn’t sound that great the base was poor and the sound that came out was very thin at low-volume. Well the speaker did have good sound at high-volume the low-volume sound was very lacking. I decided that there must be something wrong internally so I immediately returned it and bought a second one. The second one I purchased was just as easy to set up. This one immediately did sound better with the immersive sound function turned on. But I am still on the fence overall.

So what’s the hidden problem you might ask? Many reviewer’s have said to turn the “immersive sound” off, And it will sound much better. No reviewer has mentioned yet that when you turn the “immersive sound” off, it turns two of the speakers off. With the immersive sound on, sound comes from all five speakers. With the immersive sound button turn off, no sound will come from the top firing or the front firing speaker. So essentially you are left with a left and a right and a sub to produce music and sound content. WHY, has amazon chosen to do this, I’m not sure? Maybe someone can chime in and comment on this. I would have thought that all speakers on the system would be active all the time instead of just sometimes.

I have a very high-end home theater system and understand how surroundsound works. Only delivering audio to a specific channel if there is content decoded for it. An example would be a 7.1 surround. The 2 rear channels on this type of system may not produce sound all the time, they are there for when, say a plane flies by or a an object goes behind the listener. Another example is the center channel is designed for speech and the left and right are for other sound affects. But..... this all has to do with the processor. In most processors you can choose to have a multi channel stereo sound where sound is sent equally to all speakers. This is not the case with the echo Studio. Essentially the “immersive sound” button turns your speaker into a 4.1 surround , sending specific sounds to each speaker for the surround affect. Turning the “immersive sound” off, you get a 2.1 stereo sound, killing sound from the top and the front firing speaker. Not sure I’m cool with this. I would much prefer a 4.1 stereo sound when the “immersive sound” is toggled off than a 2 channel stereo.

Amazon..... care to chime in?

I’ll play with this more and report back what I find and update this review, but in the mean time I’m not sure I’m gonna keep this 🤔",4,-0.5751,Negative,544
17,"I really wanted to love this speaker. My father is an apple fanatic and praises his homepods, which I will admit have incredible sound. If they could integrate with Alexa or even plug into a Dot, I would have bought one in a heartbeat. I was hoping this would be on the same level, but alas it is not.

While this is by far the best echo speaker you can buy, it's not quite up to snuff with the competition. Because I am so integrated in the Alexa ecosystem this speaker will remain with me, but I was somewhat disappointed when it first started playing. It is not very loud, the sound is a little washed out, and the bass leaves some to be desired. I am however impressed with how responsive Alexa is, even at high volumes. I'm guessing they could cram more microphones and it really shows.

Overall, by far the best first party alexa speaker you can buy (I haven't had a chance to try sonos or any others). But at the end of the day, it is one step below some of the competition.",3,0.9802,Positive,188
18,"You won't be disappointed! Great room filler and more! This smart speaker has amazing sound & bass!

I had the opportunity to compare this to the Apple HomePod and this blows it away! I can't imagine
what this would be like if you pair this with another Echo Studio and adding the Echo subwoofer for a stereo
2.1 sound because just one of these alone sounds amazing! I like how it was packaged as well. Amazon paid a lot of attention to the smallest of details and the box opening
was nice!

I can't find anything to complain about this smart speaker from Amazon. If there's anything
that I would like Amazon to change is making this smart speaker available in white (sandstone)
like their Amazon Echo Plus speaker. I would definitely get the Echo Studio in white! Great job Amazon!",5,0.9911,Positive,141
19,"Let me start out my review by saying I have purchased five different kindle tablets and at least four amazon type speakers from the dots to this studio. I am not an Amazon fanboy - but I do enjoy their products and appreciate their pricing. I also gave this speaker its teething period before I decided to write this as I was a preorder 1st day delivery customer.

Let me start by saying if this speaker is going to be used to play music from your 24bit capable phone - its great. The sound is bass heavy and you will very likely be turning it down a notch to appreciate all it has to offer at the higher volumes. That said - where this thing does not shine, is in every other feature.

As others have stated the light bar is at such an angle that you are often peaking at the top to tell if it heard you so often time you just have to assume it does and wait to hear the feedback. Not a deal breaker.

The speaker is large but nothing you wouldn't see in a sub woofer but for a speaker id use like a right or left, its very large as a satellite type speaker without the height of a standard tower that would let you forgive it. - again not a deal breaker.

Now where the deal breaking starts is whether or not this is connected via an optical audio this device SUFFERS with the ebs and flows of your internet connection. It is so sensitive to your internet setting that it cannot even calibrate or produce its calibration audio with less than perfect internet. This is such a true statement, that I actually returned my first studio as defective because AMAZON's technical support and developers thought there was a serious bug in it and had me ship it to a persons name at one of their centers for analysis. I was even asked for video recordings of the bugs mine was producing.

If you have less than stellar internet and mine is 200mbs down cable type internet - my Alexa when asked questions would have her audio clip. After about 10 resets of my modem - calling ISP - and updating software on my Alexa I reduced this from a permanent aspect of my Studio to a 10% occurrence.

So did it get better = Yes. did it go away....no.

You said 24bit audio sounds great? Yes it does. But lets caveat that. If you have a 4k Fire stick. The one they link to in this product description as compatible > its not. Not truly. You can pay for Amazon HD music and get up to 24bit type audio and play it through the studio on your phone. But Amazon HD on your firestick is only capable of 16bit. I have a yet to be responded to ticket for that. Which is why Im finally nail in coffining this device and sending my 2nd one back.

What about use paired to firestick. How does that work? Its a pain. Not undoable, but not intuitive. If you want the studio to have volume UP/DOWN with remote you have to group it into a room AND set a home theatre system up. Not bad but not naturally intuitive. Setting up the speaker to pair with the smart TV or firestick you think would be enough or you could go in the firestick and change the Equipment management = nope. You spend so much time in the app making/breaking connections > its truly maddening.

Stability? Lets talk about that 10% failure rate on this. What this equates to is when everything else is sailing on your internet for no reason the studio will have audio pop while being your firestick audio. Then because you hit pause, to go to the restroom, when you resume the lips no longer sync. OK maybe you just need to go to firestick and set the lip sync once in the setting > false assumption. You will set it and it may work for that resumed playback. But you pause again > back to out of sync. Again maddening. This if where I get into the fishing type comments is no matter how sure you've got something pegged some other variable makes your setup not work and lose all confidence you were even doing the right thing to begin with.

I love amazon products when they work and I wanted to believe in the 3d audioscape of this device but this one is not ready as many have described. If this thing does 3d audio, I cant truly tell, and honestly I don't have the patience to wait any longer to find out because I spend more time on forums and in that Alexa app messing with settings/pairings to make something that should be near plug and play for how long they've been in this smart home hub/speaker business.

All this speaker has done now is make me want to reconsider buying a new nighthawk router and modem > which every other day up to this point I didn't think i needed. And honestly the only reason this thing makes me want to waste more money is to compensate this things very probable lack of readiness for the market. Its just too much of a gamble in this first run.",1,0.9975,Positive,901
20,"Has to be played at high volumes to really enjoy. This thing really shines when the volume exceeds 65% or so, but for most people I don't think they will normally play it that loud as it will be heard easily by your next door neighbors. At volumes less than 40%, where I suspect most people will use this device, there really is no difference in sound from the normal Echo. Most times people are streaming talk radio, or lower bit rate audio stations and again, it will sound very similarly to the normal Echo. So unless you are listening to a high bit rate streaming service at quite loud levels, I think you can pass on this device.

Also, why hasn't Amazon put a small LiOn battery in these things?? I want to be able to unplug and move this device from the kitchen to outside, but when I do that the whole powers off and it has to reboot. For $200 this is a ridiculous omission!",3,-0.5994,Negative,168
21,"I wanted this speaker as soon as it was released.
I mentioned to a close friend how excited I was about this this addition to the echo family.
He surprised me and bought it for my birthday!!
I added it to my smart tv with the fire stick.wow!!!
I only have the one studio speaker and the sound is great.
I have read reviews that say to get excellent theater sound you should have 2 studio speakers/sub woofer yet with my high ceiling and open space 1 speaker is more than great. If I added more speakers my neighbors would kill me 😂😂

22,"I waited 5 weeks to receive this speaker. Which I wasn’t told until after I placed the pre-order that it would take this long. But that’s beside the point. I’ve read the interesting Amazon reviews on the Echo Studio while being patient and I still knew it was worth at least trying this speaker out. I’m not an audiophile, but I have good hearing. I’m not exaggerating when I say, the 3rd generation Echo Dot (yes the dot) paired with or without a sub is 10x better of an experience then this Echo Studio. The Echo Studio sounds like 3 instruments trying to be a team but are clearly hung over. Man the sound is so hollow and muffled. It’s like they put someone inside an empty Costco warehouse, ducked taped the man’s mouth and told him to annunciate the ABC’s but meanwhile it just sounds like Ariana Grande singing a verse. Just noise. I turned down the bass, turned it back up, turned up the treble, tried the spatial audio sound thingamajig. Placed it in the middle of the room, in a corner, directly in front of me.

In summation, I encourage you to spend $200 on this because you can always return it. Don’t take my word for it, I’m just telling you my personal experience. I have 3 third generation echo dots throughout my home and those have a RICH sound that I’m very impressed by. Even just one by itself. I went to Amazon 4 Star store in Berkeley yesterday and tried the Echo and Echo Plus..... literally the Echo Dot was still the winner for me. It’s $24 right now and I’m laughing at how size doesn’t matter.

And don’t get me started on the stupid Amazon Unlimited Music HD promos they bribe you with and then act like they never existed. Out of 10 million songs, only a small hand full are 24 bit quality sound. And they charge you on separate days for the HD. The Unlimited plan isn’t lumped together with HD. WTF! It’s all jacked up. Spotify premium is still the winner when it comes to sound quality.

I’m a loyal Amazon customer. I’m confident Echo Studio next year will be the one to buy.

Good luck =)",1,0.998,Positive,377
23,"I don't have a clue why anyone would say it doesn't play music nor work. This thing plugged into my wireless network as easily as all the other Alexa devices.

Music playback is better - much better - than the other Echo devices (because of the speakers). It does very well with Amazon HD music giving me a sense of directionality! It is integrated with my HiFi system and TV all without a lot of extra effort.

Definitely worth it....",5,0.9414,Positive,80
24,"I'll get the conclusion out the way: The speaker sounds surprisingly great

For context, I own 2 Sonos One speakers and an Apple Homepod. I've always been lukewarm on the Sonos as their sound, while fairly good, doesn't match their price in my opinion. The Homepod, too, has always felt overpriced if not a decent sounding speaker.

When the Echo Studio was announced, I figured I'd give it a shot given I could always send it back with Amazon's excellent return policy if it didn't live up to snuff. $200 put it below the Homepod and right around the Sonos One pricepoint so my expectations were set around there.

Setup was simple as the device came pre-linked with my Amazon account. It goes through an initial room test where it plays some tones to measure the size and placement within the room (something it does continually should you move it around anyway). After that, all that was left was to listen to some music.

I started with some Sinatra to get a feel for the vocals, and was immediately impressed with the tone & clarity. You could easily pick up on the subtle percussion on the background and the band hits packed a punch when they came in behind him. Next I tried some classical to get a feel for the range and, again, came away impressed. You could feel the lows of the brass section just as well as the high strings. The material was all represented well.

Ok, so how about something that thumps. I asked Alexa to play some Chemical Brothers and this is where I got really impressed. Too many speakers, in my opinion, emphasize the volume of bass over accuracy. You end up with a boomy sound that doesn't reflect the music properly. Not the Echo Studio. The bass was punchy, loud and accurate. I tried some Daft Punk and Deadmau5 and came away equally impressed with the tight bass and crisp highs.

Next I tried some Metallica. I feel if there's a critique I'd have with the Echo Studio it'd be here. The mid guitars lack a little feel and all start to sound a bit muddied together. You get the bass, you get the highs, but the guitars lack a little range. This isn't at all uncommon on speakers like this (the Sonos are quite bad in this regard in my opinion), but it could definitely be better).

I tried a handful of the 3D audio selections on Amazon Music. In short, you do get a wider soundstage which is interesting, but you lose something in the clarity of the music. It feels a little gimmicky maybe, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just an ""I don't know if this is actually an improvement or not"" kind of way.

In short, I'm very, very impressed with the Echo Studio. It's priced right at $200, has tighter and more accurate bass than the Homepod and a much fuller range than the Sonos One. If you're looking for a good speaker for music (with the bonus of having Alexa built in), I can't recommend this one enough.

I came in skeptical. I came away impressed.",5,0.9889,Positive,531
25,"This is a nice speaker and a great value as an alternative to an Echo in a bedroom or kitchen or especially, in a multi-room setup. It has everything the new Echo has with better sound and it's only a fifty dollars upgrade (provided you get the hub in both). So the difference in sound quality is well worth it. But understand it's limitations and advantages before you buy one.

I bought 2 Studios and set them up as a stereo pair and the sound get's loud and it stays clear. I compared them to my Definitive Tech speakers and okay, not even close, the $1000 Def's blew them away. But that's a 600 premium. So, let's compare them to my sons HomePods at 300. Much closer comparison. But still, the HomePod's clarity and sound stage win but not by much. But usually you're either in the Apple or Amazon ecosystem so not really relevant. Then I put them next to the new Echo's and at normal volume the Studio win's in both clarity and bass. The Echo's bass is way too boomy (although the sounds not bad in the new Echo) and that affects the clarity. At louder volumes, the Studio's crush. And it's only $50 more, if both have hubs, however even if you compare it to the $99 Echo it's well worth the upgrade. But remember, it's a substitute for an Echo not a dedicated home theater or music.

As for the sound, it's spacious. It fills the room and provides a deep listening environment. However, that does effect the focus. It's hard to identify precisely where instruments are coming from (even when paired in stereo) but to get big, deep sound, that's a problem with all lower-end speakers. The clarity is amazing, no bass boom here. Even fine wind instruments are clearly heard. This was for me the aspect that stood out. Too many speaker makers tend to over-emphasize the bass (Sonos!). But that's what sells to many customers. It seems like Amazon didn't fall into that trap. That's not to say it lacks bass but its not overwhelming. If you want big boom, use an equalizer. So overall I like the sound, especially for a bedroom but don't buy it for GREAT sound. You can do better with 400, but you'll give up the convenience of Alexa and a hub.

Pairing 2 in stereo improves the sound but not to the point it can compete with most dedicated systems so I don't see the point. Yes, it improves the depth and gives better imagining then one but is it really a main listening system worth $400? Especially when you can't play 5.1 and the optical input won't split to allow stereo from an outside source? It doesn't improve the sound to the point it can compare with the sound or function book shelf speakers. Remember you're paying for Alexa and a hub where speaker makers are putting the money into better speakers. Get two put them in different rooms and enjoy what it does best, multi-room music and have Alexa in 2 rooms.

The issue when considering these for a Home Theater system or as a replacement for a soundbar is that they ONLY play with content that comes through the Amazon Fire. That's a problem. Want to replace your sound bar with these? Well not if you have cable, a game system or DVD and don't want mono sound. I know wires are so 2000 but not when you have content from another source without physically connecting and disconnecting the input each time. Especially when the studio's sound can't play stereo let alone compete with a 5.1 or 7.1 system when you use the optical input.

So where do these excel? First - In a multi-room setup this is a great system. You can buy 10 Studio's and still be paying for the wiring of a traditional multi-room set-up. And it would sound great. No doubt, this is a huge positive. Second - In an apartment where you want better sound, have a soundbar for TV and a smaller space to fill with sound. And lastly, if you are considering a new Echo or Echo Plus. For a little more $ you can get better sound and Alexa.

In the end, anywhere you want better sound and Alexa makes this a nice upgrade.",3,0.9992,Positive,729

29,"The Echo Studio sounds great; I had two paired for stereo and quite enjoyed what I heard. However, when linked to my 2nd generation Fire TV Cube the pair produced only stuttering, distorted noise. The problem turned out to be an apparent defect with one of the Studios; it sounded no better linked alone to the Cube than it did as part of a stereo pair. That one has already been returned. Now, the other Studio sounds fine with the Cube - apart from the very occasional and very annoying drop-out during playback. Also, I notice that when playing the ""Best of 3D"" playlist from Amazon HD every song cuts off just before its end. This happens only when the Studio is playing from a verbal command. It doesn't happen when the same music is played in conjunction with the Amazon HD app on the Cube, nor does it happen with other playlists. Another odd thing - when paired with one Studio or two, for surround sound the Cube defaults to ""Always Dolby Digital Plus"", and this setting cannot be adjusted. ??? Note that all updates were and continue to be applied to every device. I have another Studio due to arrive tomorrow. Hoping to hear then what all those writing rave reviews have heard. If not, I'll hold on to both as long as I can in hopes future updates will remedy all problems.

Update: After replacing the defective Studio and linking the new one with its counterpart and the the Fire Cube, things are looking up. The Studios are playing music and movies in sync with the Cube, and they sound great. The Cube still defaults to """"Always Dolby Digital Plus"", though, which can't be right. So, I've upgraded the rating to four stars in hopes future updates will remedy remaining issues.

Update 2: Amazon has lately issued updates to the Fire Cube at the rate of one approximately every 2-3 days. Today both the Cube and the Studio received updates. And, voila! The Cube is no longer limited to DD+ when linked to the Studios. Amazon's attention to remedying problems with newly released product is creditable.

Set up was simple enough through Alexa app. This speaker sounds great when is on full blast, but when you put it at a lower volume setting it disappoints. You can hear static, (kinda like a microphone when is on). When you turn it up it goes away. But I’m hoping that they can update it or somehow fix it.

I’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .

I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.

I’ll address three improvement areas:
1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔

2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.

3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.

BOTTOM LINE
I like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.

The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.

FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.

If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.

————————————————————

The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.

From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.

I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.

In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...",5,0.9959,Positive,702
33,"Nice product from amazon, well built hardware, setup was fast. Sound quality is poor, I am hoping this will change soon.

As with other Echo devices you cannot Android Cast to the device. You can only cast from the amazon music app, or use bluetooth.

This really is a nice speaker. The sound quality is poor because of the tone balancing software (equalizer) deficiencies.

The device control software only has a three band EQ. This ""studio"" device needs more refinement than 3 bands. The stereo separation enhancement sounds unrealistic. I turned this off and it sounds much more natural.

I ran the setup routine several times with the device in different locations. It just sounds like a cheap boom box.

I did do the setup calibration in its current location and ran it for several days before
I wrote this review.

This is just not that good with the current software. I would not recommend it and I will not buy another one unless the software (setup calibration and/or echo control) gets much better.

Had to get it from Best Buy with free overnight shipping, because of amazon delay on shipping, for some reason it would not arrive until December.",2,0.948,Positive,200
34,"I am an echo nut (after the ability to group and the addition of Sirius XM) so I have a good selection of types and generations. This Studio is something. For the money I can't imagine finding something that sounds as rich and fills a room (or two or three) with such a tidal wave of music. Paired it with the sub and will get in line for another to create a stereo pair. Stopped in the Amazon store on 34th Street and they had just one playing - you could not tell where the music was coming from, it was just everywhere.",5,0.8885,Positive,103
35,"Voice response seemed worse than my Echo Show v2. The music sounded pretty good when it worked, but it was pretty glitchy with Spotify interaction. Finally, it emitted a buzzing sound along with any voice responses. That was the deal-breaker and it got boxed back up and returned.",1,0.743,Positive,48
36,"(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.

Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:
The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).

Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.

Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

37,"This is an incredible product I have purchased all Echo products and this is has far exceeded my expectations. I worry about the concerns of the microphones listening in on ur conversations but take comfort they can be turned off. The sound is rich, enveloping and awesome. I have an open room 24x 16 but a smaller room would be so much richer. The sound carries at full volume with barely any distortion. Brava amazon.",5,0.9679,Positive,75
38,"I bought an echo studio and first one arrived in early December 2019 I thought that I just had a dirty power situation so I tried plugging it into a variety of different power outlets still the problem persisted so I returned the product because it was making static sound every time I turned on and then turned off with the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi music streaming or asked Alexa a question I would hear static During and for five seconds after stopping the music or asking Alexa a question, So I called Amazon echo support and they advised me to return the product to the lab for review I received the replacement on Christmas Eve December 24, 2019 however the second unit also exhibits the same defect of static during music play back as well as five seconds after the music stops both using Bluetooth music streaming and Wi-Fi music streaming as well as asking Alexa a question until they can fix this I don’t see any other option but to live with this problem however another pet peeve of mine is that unlike my echo plus is that the echo studio does not allow you to control Bluetooth music streaming options: play/pause skip forward/backward a track(s) With voice commands to Alexa because of this I am very unsatisfied with this product, I wish they could make it as functional as an echo plus with a thermometer and Bluetooth control for music so I wish Amazon would push this upgrade of bluetooth control through a software update as soon as possible I would appreciate that very much as I’m sure many other echo studio customers would.",1,0.7445,Positive,276
39,"So far so good! Once it gets set up right, it is amazing. I have been avoiding buying a soundbar in hopes of finding something like this. And the Studio more than satisfied. For now one speaker is enough in my apartment living room.

It is so good, that I now plan to upgrade to a second speaker to get surround sound in a couple of months when I get a house. The bass rumbles! The midrange is all there and the highs are clean! I can hear dialogue very well over the sound and it’s a huge upgrade from the decent TV speakers I have been using.

My main complaint right now is that the Fire TV 4K remote will not pair to the Studio. The instructions in the Alexa app show that you can pair the remote to it, but this isn’t possible. I called customer service after many tries, and the very nice customer service guy at Amazon said this isn’t functional right now. He said there is no notes about if this will ever be functional.

That means you have to control the volume with your voice, even though you can still control everything else in your Fire TV with the remote. Come on Amazon, please fix this ASAP! The volume is so good on the speaker that you have to yell at Alexa just to turn the volume down. And it pauses the volume and it’s just awkward. Fix this!

Also, I don’t love how the speaker will unpair from the Fire Stick when you play your own music through the speaker even when using a skill. You have to reconnect either manually through the Fire Stick settings or figure out how to exactly tell “Alexa pair to xxxxx’s Fire TV” without messing it up. This should be seamless or continuous. Please make this easier!

Overall it’s a great experience! If those two issues are fixed it will be a 5* system.",4,0.9872,Positive,327
40,"My only complaint is the sound quality and not the quantity. It gets very loud, but the sound is harsh and unrefined compared to my Homepod and Sonos speakers. With the sound quality being below standard, it ruins any benefits of 3D music. Timbre is unnatural and sounds overly processed, even with 3D spatial turned off.

It basically sounds like a very loud Echo Plus with more bass. The bass is also overdone and boomy for music. If you are not an audiophile or particular about sound, these issues that I mention may go unnoticed.

It gets loud though and Alexa is of course awesome. I wish I could give 2.5 stars",2,0.8201,Positive,112
41,"I ended up returning the Echo Studio because to my ears the sound quality was not quite on par with my Sonos One speaker. I was hoping to replace the Sonos with the Echo because of Sonos's sometimes glitchy software but the tradeoff in sound quality was not worth it to me. The Echo Studio does have stronger bass but the Sonos One has a richer, tighter, more refined sound - it is absolutely the better choice for listening to music. (I am an Amazon Prime HD music subscriber, and I spent a lot of time comparing these two speakers.) Also, the footprint of the Sonos One is also much smaller than the Echo Studio's, and it can be placed as close as one inch to a wall - the Echo must be placed at least six inches from a wall.",3,0.9351,Positive,141
42,"I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.

First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!

One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.

I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.

I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!

Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.

However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.

I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.

Thanks Amazon tech girl!

43,"Update on 12/15/2020
It's gotten worse. First, the reboots started happening more frequently: Now they're up to 2 to 3 times a day, including sometimes within 2 minutes of the previous reboot. And just yesterday something new started happening: My volume starts to either go up or go down on its own. I hear the ""beep beep"" as if I'm pressing on the volume up or down buttons, but no one's pressing anything.

I've now unplugged it and am waiting for a replacement. It's on back order, so Amazon a month ago told me I'll have to wait until the end of the year for a new one.

Original Review:

I am... disappointed. First, the good: The sound is great, it fills the room very well and, as you expect, setup and folding it into the Alexa ecosystem is a breeze.

But I certainly have a lot of criticisms. I'm using this as a speaker for my TV, and HERE is where it just falls down hard.

So here are all my problems and complaints:

1. When I use it as an Alexa home theater group for my 4K Fire Stick, it constantly disconnects when I pause my video. Even when it works, I lose maybe 10 seconds of sound before it reconnects. But when I pause video for ""too long"", it doesn't reconnect for... well, I've sometimes waited 30 seconds to a minute before giving up and having to re-do my home theater group. Once I redo my home theater group (basically, just editing the existing home theater group, unselecting and reselecting the Studio, and clicking save) then it seems to work. Until my next pause. This is hella frustrating.

This happens A LOT. The long pause to reconnect happens almost each time, and having to redo my home theater group is maybe every other day. I can't help but compare to my Sonos speakers (in a different home) where I can't even tell it's on Wifi, it ""just works"".

2. So, instead, I tried connecting to the TV directly with an audio cable because my thinking went: if it's directly connected, then maybe it won't do that pause and certainly maybe it won't drop completely. Nope, same thing. It's as if it's ignoring the direct connection and still using wifi for sound.

3. Alright, so I switched to using an Apple TV instead of the Fire Stick. MUCH better: The reconnect time goes down to maybe a few seconds and it hasn't dropped at all. BUT now that I'm using Apple TV, I can't control the volume with my Fire Stick remote. So either I have to do it via voice or the physical buttons (what is this, the 80's?).

4. Now it's definitely better (but it's frustrating that it works better when NOT using the Fire Stick!). But lastly, the wake functionality seems to be significantly over-sensitive. We're watching something, and maybe we make a sound or just move on the couch (not even words) and the Studio mutes the video sound and listening to a command from us. It's just tooo sensitive and interrupts our viewing a lot. I'd like to try to turn off the microphone while watching TV, but then I can't use voice to change the volume! Ugh!

5. Finally, ever since I plugged it into the TV via a hardwire, it seems to reboot a lot. Like, two or 3 times a week. This is not good either.

Yes, I've reset it, I've re-paired it, I've examined my network (I'm a tech person) and it all points to the Studio.",1,0.3419,Positive,598
44,"This is a great way to throw away $200.00 and even better, Amazon will NOT stand behind the product to offer a refund or a replacement, so that speaks volumes about their belief in the product. Will NOT connect with ANY device that I own. Yes I have gone through the reset procedure numerous times, even watched dozens of you tube videos to no avail. I have several other blue-tooth speakers that connect within seconds, but NOT the Studio. If you are going to produce a trash product, at least stand behind what you sell and put your name on. This will BE the LAST amazon product I purchase. If you are reading this and want an honest opinion, go with anything that BOSE produces, they are a top notch company with top notch products.

45,"Being a long time audiophile( I have Pass Lab equipment), I was not expecting much from the echo studio. I have 3 echo plus, in my home. I bought them primarily for smart home purposes and occasional background music. The 3 pluses were very satisfactory in that role. However I must say the studio is a different animal. Listening to the new 3D HD sound, I was somewhat floored, that type of sound could come from a single speaker. Bass that grunts, like my 1000 what B&W subwoofer. Very good midrange clarity. Not the most sparkly treble, my Pass system gives, but very acceptable. The sound from the studio is quite large and fills my kitchen, wall to wall. Loudness is not an issue with this speaker. Voice commands to the studio, is superior to the the other alexa’s. Even when when the speaker is playing loud, it can still hear commands from your voice. Remember, as with any speaker, placement is important to get the bet sound. I have my studio near a rear wall, and this makes the bass more authoritative and more to my liking. I use Pandora for my music source and although it does not stream the resolution as some of the better music service, the sound from the the studio is very good. If you purchase this speaker, do not judge it until you try the sample HD music from amazon. That is when this speaker shows you what it does best. Buy it!",5,0.9908,Positive,250
46,"I got mine from B Buy. Had one ordered from Amazon but I didn't want to wait until mid December. Got one last week and I was so impressed that I ordered a second which I got today. One sounds very good but two paired with an echo sub sounds amazing. I do agree with many other reviews that you should turn off the spatial enhancement. I am an old guy and most of the music I listen to is from the 70's and 80's. I was very surprised and happy that Amazon music HD has most of my music in HD or even ultra HD but none of it in 3d. If your music isn't in 3d, turn it off.
Setup is easy and takes about 2 minutes. I have had no problems except for one of them repeating my music requests twice. I have over a dozen echo devices and they all hiccup once in a while so that was not a big deal.

 I bought a BRAND NEW Echo Studio on November 22, 2020, and waited nearly a month before my purchase finally shipped on December 19, 2020. It set up very easily and was connected to my account without problem. Within less than a week, every time I asked ""Alexa"" to perform a task (eg. play music, play NPR), she would start the task briefly and then freeze with a loud annoying buzz and would fail to respond again, until 1) she seemed to reset herself, or 2) I unplugged her and plugged her back in. I phoned and spoke with tech support for Alexa devices (outsourced to the Philippines) with whom I spent about an hour on the phone, while he coached me through various attempts to fix, including resetting the device. None of this worked. I asked for an exchange, and when I *specifically asked* to make sure I'd be getting a brand new device, he said yes of course I would get a new device. Well, he LIED. Amazon tech support LIED. What I ended up getting in return was ""Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa - R"". The ""- R"" means REFURBISHED! I bought a BRAND NEW device, had it for less than 1 week, was lied to about the replacement being new, and ended up with a REFURBISHED device. There is terrible customer support! Why not just return the defective device for a refund and re-buy a brand new one? Because when I bought it on November 22, it was a special deal for a cheaper price, bundled with two ""free"" Phillips Hue bulbs. It's back up to full price now. That said, see for yourself in my video (taken just today before I return the defective unit to Amazon).

48,"Update: After I posted my review, I was contacted by technical support. The rep did troubleshooting, with no success. I sent additional information over the next couple of days and did more testing. The rep called again and took some more readings to send to developers. Still no resolution and no additional information from technical support. They may be done with me. I no longer am using the Studio with my Fire TV Cube. The lag and getting it back on track again is too frustrating. It has been a waste of time and apparently $200 flushed down the toilet. Good thing I only bought one. I was going to buy another if it would work.
-------------------
I was an early adopter and had postponed writing an honest review until now. I understand that early issues are usually fixed a few weeks later. But several months later and several contacts later there is no resolution to my issue. Technical support has been very unresponsive. I was told they were going to research my issue and get back with me and they never did. The last time I spoke with a rep, they sent a replacement. That did not help. The issue that I have is there becomes a video/voice synch issue after watching certain shows for a while. My set up is a Fire TV Cube and also an Amazon Recast DVR with the Echo Studio. To temporarily get rid of the synch issue, I have to restart the Fire TV Cube, but then there is no sound from the Echo Studio. So I have to unplug the Echo Studio and plug it back in. Then sound works again. Some days I have to do this more than once a day. As far as the sound system, when it works, the Echo Studio is great for movies and music, with a couple reservations. For music, the sound can be great. However, only some Amazon Music apps give you full quality. You don't get full quality from the Fire TV app, but I do from my phone app, or directly from the Echo Studio. For movies, the Echo Studio has good sound and a pair of them is much more immersive. However, two Echo Studios do not work as a pair when you are playing a movie through a disc player (I have a Samsung 4k bluray player). Only one Echo Studio works (The one with the cable into the player). The quality of picture and sound is better when playing a 4k disc versus streaming, but unfortunately sound only plays through one Echo Studio. So, months later there are still too many issues and limitations. I would not recommend at this point.",1,0.8847,Positive,452
49,"Updating my original review and upgrading to 5 stars. I had originally bought a pair of Echo Studios to use with my Fire TV Cube as a stereo speaker pair. There was an annoying bug that I encountered and reported to Amazon, and within a week, the bug was fixed. I have since bought another Studio for another room because the sound quality is amazing. For my ""home theater"" experience, I configured the two Echo Studios as right and left stereo speakers. As a few other reviewers have said, if you use your Studio with a Fire TV device, you do not need to bother with buying the Echo sub woofer. The Studio has a really rich range of sound, including the bass frequencies, and because it configures itself to bounce sound waves off of your walls and ceiling, the Studio creates a pretty amazing immersive sound experience (for movies and shows that support it). I haven't tried the 3D songs on Amazon Music yet -- there aren't a lot so far, but I expect the experience will be great.",5,0.9434,Positive,180

If you turn the volume off and then ask Alexa a question, you can hear the buzzing noise. We returned the echo and got the regular echo speaker. That one has a distinctive hissing noise when the speaker comes on but it's better than the popping and buzzing I guess.

Also customer service has gotten so so so so bad. People hang up on you in chat and then they auto connect you to someone new who doesn't know what's going on. A lot of them have very little english. Troubleshooting was a nightmare. Oof.",2,-0.5228,Negative,122
51,"Background:
Have had Dots for years, but never played music through them obviously. Recently purchased an Echo 3 and was very impressed with the sound which seemed to defy the small size, and which prompted me to purchase a second Echo 3, so I would have music in a couple areas that did not have speakers. These Echo 3’s are perfect for spreading music that will sound great throughout the house, not sacrificing great sound.

Echo Studio:
Decided to take a chance with the mother of all Echoes, the Studio. Received it a couple days ago. Setup was a breeze. The speaker will appear in your app once it is shipped. Brilliant! I listen to a variety of types of music from pop to dance to classical. This speaker plays all of them well, though obviously tracks with a lot of bass bring this baby alive. Pandora tracks sound great. I haven’t used Amazon Music much.. until now. The HD & Ultra HD tracks are incredible, allowing me to hear the individual instruments while listening to classical music. That extra bit rate is worth the extra cost and what this Studio deserves. Would like a little more control with the equalizer, but it works, and maybe Amazon will give us a control to fine tune later. At 199.00, having experienced this speaker, it’s a nobrainer. I had been wanting the HomePod, but no way was I going to spend that amount on one speaker. Also, the Studio allows groups, multiple sources of music and easy to stream from your phone. Sonos & HomePod are more limited. I will definitely purchase another Studio at some point, if there is ever a sale, it will be even sooner.

Support:
As an aside, I applaud Amazon for having dedicated Alexa support, and staff that actually know the products. When I’ve had a question and able to get routed, the support is BRILLIANT... there’s that word again.

Conclusion:
Amazon, you’ve converted this Apple fan to an Echo fan & supporter for my home speaker needs. Brilliant!",5,0.9981,Positive,342
52,"This is a nicely made and presented product. I had high hopes for it, but it is a bit disappointing. Here's why...

Sitting close, it sounds full and powerful. Moving away the impact drops off very quickly. Also, as you turn up the volume, the amplifiers dynamics processing is very audible and the bass is reduced noticeably. It kind of comes in and out, so it loses ""punch"".

Also, I am not a fan of the imaging or soundstage. Seems pretty point source to me and flat. I know Amazon has specially encoded ""Atmos"" tracks to show off the soundstage, but that not what I'm listening to 99.9% of the time.

I find myself not using it most of the time... it just seems a little fake sounding. I like the original Echo device better even though it is not in the same class output or bass wise, it is more listenable and truthful to me. I can accept its shortcomings because it more honest sounding.

The other HUGE issue to me is the inability of voice recognition circuitry to work when it doing what it's designed to do... play loudly. You end up screaming at it. I've used much better implementations of the Echo solution that can understand voice commands when a lot is more going on in the room, sound wise.

I know I could use two of them and add a sub, but at that point might as well get a real hi-fi and an echo dot for $22.00 and call it a day.

Hey, you guys asked...",3,0.992,Positive,261
53,"I have pretty much all the Amazon/Echo devices....actually more than my living space requires or needs. My favorite Echo device is still the original 1st generation hub, I was one of the beta testers to use it so we have 5 years of history together. Great sound, sensitive voice recognition, has never missed a beat and is still going strong. But I bought into the 3D audio high-fidelity hype and purchased the Studio to replace my original Echo in the living room.

The Studio is OK, meh, just OK for me. I am not an audiophile so I can't comment on the highs/mids/bass or begin to understand Dolby Atmos technology, you can read the many other reviews for that info. I do however subscribe to Amazon Music so I enjoy streaming music low in the background during my day to day routine or Alexa responding to one of many commands/questions I ask of her each day. Audio texting with my friends (also who all own Echos) is a hoot!

To tell the truth I really feel that my original had just as good sound, maybe not the deep tones but this Studio was not worth spending the extra money for, glad I got it at sale price. I also find it drops wifi frequently (never had that issue before) or I will look up to see the blue ring rotating around and around for no apparent reason and you also have to abide by the Studio space requirements. I think the spoken word is a little muddier, not as crisp, with the Studio (hard to explain). I, at times, have to repeat commands or yell at the Studio to turn on/off lights so I don't think this device is as sensitive to my voice like the original is. I seem to get a little bit more frustrated with using this unit. AND was pretty bummed to discover that the Echo volume remote does not work with this unit either! What the heck! It's an audio device that should have a remote volume control.

I mean I am going to keep it but this is not going to be an Echo device that I will be recommending to family or friends. I just think that some of the other Echo devices have decent enough audio quality, for the average person, uses a smaller foot print that can be placed pretty much anywhere in a room.",4,0.9936,Positive,404
54,"I wanted to replace my smart TV's wired soundbar with a wireless one and decided to give the Echo Studio a try. I bought an Echo Studio and a Fire Stick 4k.

The TV/Fire Stick/Echo Studio setup was simple but the truth is the Echo Studio never really worked well. It simply won't stay connected and will go silent after 20 or 30 minutes.

One month after the purchase I still haven't been able to watch a whole movie using the Echo Studio.

And every time I turn on the TV, I need to use the Alexa app to unpair the Fire Stick and the Echo Studio and set it up again. But again the connection will never last more than 20 or 30 minutes and I'll have to stop whatever we are watching, open the Alexa app on the phone, unpair the Echo Studio and do the setup again.

I have tried factory resetting both the Fire stick and the Echo Studio a few times, but to no avail.

I have other Echo devices at home and never had connection problems with them.

My WiFi connection is very stable and there are not many other devices connected to it.

I called Amazon Tech Support about the problem, again to no avail.

The only way I could get the Echo Studio to work with my TV was through an optical cable, which is exactly why I bought the Echo Studio in the first place: to get rid of the wired connection.

Bottom line is: I spent $250 to replace my wired soundbar with a wireless one and ended up with a soundbar that will only work when it's wired.",1,-0.7053,Negative,279
55,"Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.

I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case. Brand new out of the box with a static noise and wasn’t offered a new replacement.",4,0.8425,Positive,568
56,"Bought this from Best Buy so didn't have to wait until December release. Wanted it to listen to high resolution music. It fits the bill. Alexa app. needs some work. Tech support is terrible. They don't know much about the product other than what they read on cue cards. Also, now Amazon interrupts music streams with their own commercials. Trying to sell Audible Books. 😡 Like the speaker enough to keep it.",4,0.6908,Positive,72
57,"I was excited to receive this but after listening to music on it for an hour, I'm returning it.

There is very little bass or kick to the music, maybe I received a defective unit?

Even without bass, the sound is inconsistent though. Moving it to different rooms/locations did not help, nor did disabling the spatialization under its settings. My echo studio sounds muted and even like a blown speaker with the way certain highs become twiny (like on a 1st Gen echo dot). Some songs sound ok but others are just plain awful and a pain to listen to on a speaker advertised as ""studio quality"". This does not come close to studio or even Bose quality. My echo dot paired with a Bose soundlink mini sounds several times better than this.

This was not the quality I was expecting at $200. Invest in a 3rd gen echo instead. The sound on those is a bit better than this assuming the unit I received was not defective.",1,0.8911,Positive,168
58,"The hype is real with this. It sounds incredible for it's size and after putting it side by side with our home pod, the homepod got demolished in terms of bass output and clarity when cranked and I would say ***AFTER A VERY NECESSARY FIRMWARE UPDATE ON THE ECHO STUDIO*** they're about on par with sound quality/clarity at lower/medium volume.

I say that update in bold because out of the box, as you may have heard/read, the 3D audio setting on the Studio makes the sound worse unless you're listening to 3D audio. More than that though, the option to disable 3D audio is not even in the audio settings. You have to actually TELL the device to update and there were 3 updates mine had to do to get to the most recent firmware version.

Once that was taken care of though, not only was the 3D audio toggle switch in the audio options but the sound quality of non 3D audio music was WAY better. They must have heard the complaints about it not sounding very good with 3D turned on and fixed whatever was going on because now, you can hear the quality and clarity DROP when you disable 3D.

I dont like the fact that I had to go to forums to figure out that I needed a firmware update AND that I had to use voice commands to do this. These things should be in the Alexa app both telling you there's a software or firmware update AND the option to always keep it up to date. The thing is always connected to the internet so I don't think that's too much to ask. All my other devices, smart TV and game consoles manage to do this so Amazon need to take action.",5,0.479,Positive,298
59,"Lots of issues when synced with fire tv cube.
-sometimes when using with tv, and a notification comes through or I ask Alexa a question, the tv sound stops playing when the notification is done playing. I have to pause the tv program and restart it in order to get tv sound back.
-sometimes tv programs on amazon prime will start to play in fast forward with the voice is at normal speed.
-sometimes the tv program will be about 10 seconds off of the voice
-sometimes when I turn the tv off or stop a tv program, the soundtrack of that tv program keeps playing until I shut the tv down or start a different program. If I ask Alexa to ""stop,"" she wants to play some song with ""stop"" in the title.

I have had the same fire cube for well over a year (2?) and never had any of these issues until I got the echo studio and synced it.

Update 2.15.20 lowering from two to one star.
all issues previously mentioned continuing.
also, usually, when I am closest to the studio, it will not respond to my voice commands, instead, one of my other, further away devices respond. When the device in the other room responds, I can hardly hear the response because it is so far away. for example, this evening i was standing two feet from the studio, with the wake word, the echo dot upstairs responded. the studio is the worst amazon device i have ever purchased. Additionally, when I am in an area farther away from the studio, and use the wake word, instead of the closest device responding, the studio will respond.
Update 3.27.20 Continue to have most of these problems, esp all problems with TV playback. In addition, the Studio suddenly stopped working with Audible. It simply ignores without any response any Audible requests. This device is still overall a POS.",1,-0.9196,Negative,321
60,"I wouldn’t call myself an audiophile, but I love the sound aspect of all media formats. I have a Dolby-Atmos-enabled sound bar for my 4K UHD blu-ray movies and streaming devices, but because it’s designed for that purpose, it’s not the perfect speaker for only listening to music, even though it sounds great.

Amazon Echo Studio is the first home smart speaker in the market that supports audio-only Dolby Atmos format via streaming. If you also happen to subscribe Amazon Music HD, you will have access to streamable music coded in Dolby Atmos format. Try the newly remastered (the one with the “3D” badge) Abbey Road by the Beatles, it sounds phenomenal: you could clear hear the depth and virtual placement of each instrument in your room.

Like most single-unit Dolby Atmos products, however, you shouldn’t just place the speaker anywhere. Yes, they promote that the speaker will automatically adjust to the acoustics of any room, but it’d work the best in a place where there can be an equal distance to a wall on either side of it with minimal obstructions in between, a flat ceiling directly over it, and your primary listening location is directly in front of it. After all, single-unit Dolby Atmos products work by bouncing sounds off of ceiling and walls.

Also, just like movies, the 3D effects of 3D music are only going to be as good as the sound mixers who have mixed them. Therefore, not all 3D music will sound as amazing as the remastered Abbey Road. Nevertheless, the speaker will still do a good job by maximizing any music source to take advantage of its 4-driver-1-woofer setup.",5,0.9957,Positive,276
61,"Attention: You must have a Fire (Fire TV stick 4K) device in order for things to run smoothly. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t say this in their advertising. I got it to connect to my Sony A8H 4K TV but it was a hit or miss when it wanted to be paired. Very frustrating!!! I contacted Amazon Customer Service on Twitter and found out that I needed a Fire device. This will be for any TV that you want to use as a stereo system.
The sound is amazing! The look is great! The quality is also great! However, it’s not fully compatible with not Fire devices. Any problems you have, you have to go through the horribly designed Alexa app. I have over 10 Amazon devices and this by far has been the worst experience!! I’m returning all 5 Amazon Studio speakers today!!!",1,-0.3299,Negative,142
62,"I bought this to replace the Echo Plus in my living room. I figured the fancy dancey new bigger Studio would be able to fill the room better. Don't get me wrong, the Plus sounded good, but not get up and boogie loud. Surely the Studio would be able to do that. Not so. I have the bass on my Plus turned down two notches, because it's just that rich. With the Studio bass turned up to max it still sounds thinner than the Plus. On top of that, at max volume the Studio is about 1/2 as loud as the Plus. Total loser on the audio front.

Combine that with the design decision to recess the light ring below the speakers so you can't see it respond if its not below eye level, and the Alexa volume/audio volume de-sync which seems to occur much more often on the Studio, and I'm going to have to say SKIP THIS GENERATION. Maybe they can fix it in software or a subsequent version, but right now this Alexa is not worth buying.",1,0.8219,Positive,180
63,"I’m so disappointed. I bought 2 studios, a sub and a 4k fire stick. I set it all up and it worked great for a month. Now it seems to lose connection with the home theater every time it goes to sleep. I’ve had to reset it 3 times today alone. My wife can’t deal with this and neither can I.

Also, the sub is way under powered. It’s very poppy when connected to the studios. And the studios themselves only calibrate to the room the very first time you connect them. So if you move them there is no way to recalibrate.

The HD audio subscription which was supposed to be 90 days free is NOT. I contacted amazon and they told me to sign up for the free 30 days and contact them every single month for a refund. Wth. So yeah I just had my first charge and I have to take my time to get my money back.

Additionally with the 3D audio and HD audio you can’t find the 3d or hd content easy. 3d is so rare that they give you a handful of play lists and most of them are only 10 songs. There is no way to search/filter for 3d audio or hd audio.

And the last problem, playing music while the TV is off the music would pause after 20 seconds for about 20 seconds then it would skip to the next song. The only way playing music works is with the TV on.",1,0.2395,Positive,253
64,"1st thoughts - it's clear, heavy and is not producing the sound I thought it should produce.

Then I found out why

Went to connect my AUX cable and run my computer though it, sounds great. Then I went to surf a few pages, wound up on Instagram and boom, there it was, the music on someone's post was coming through the way I thought it should sound. Bit rate and Decibel level of the music or move being pushed to the speaker matters. If you use your speaker with a DVD player, OMG, the bass shakes the area it's in.

Only issues I have with it, and I know why, is that it won't pair with my older Echo show, something with the hardware. ok, no problem,",5,0.8425,Positive,128
65,"I'll start by saying I love the product and the sound quality. Why the one-star rating then? Well simple, it doesn't work all the time. When it does work it is a great entry-level Dobly Atmos speaker, however, it constantly cuts out has distortion issues, and plays music for a song or two at most. I have it plugged into a 4K TV with the optic in and still get the distortion at least once a day which requires you to unplug the cord and plug it back in. The speaker just cuts out from time to time and requires you to unplug the power and plug it back in. I could understand if it worked with the music as that is Amazon's push for this speaker yet it refuses to play more than one or two songs at a time the sound just cuts off. If Amazon can patch these issues as they seem to be firmware-based my rating will go to a five-star however in the current condition it is a one-star.

*UPDATE 11/29/2020* I unhooked this speaker about one month after I wrote the original review because it was just unusable for all the reasons I listed and ended up buying a soundbar instead. It sat in my closet for a year and I decided to see if Amazon had patched it with a firmware update and maybe it works now, well it still does all the things listed above. Mind you this is the replacement speaker Amazon sent me because the first one was doing this very thing. Don't waste your money on this overpriced paperweight, get a soundbar you will be happier for it.*",1,0.967,Positive,279
66,"My first impression was negative but then I realized I was treating it as an upgrade to my Echo and locating it where the Echo had been. It should be positioned as a high quality speaker. Your listening to this device is active, not passive. After I came to this realization my experience became extremely positive. I recommend placing it across the room from you and listen to some of your favorite music at your preferred volume.

For demonstration purposes I requested that Alexa play the following:
1. Bolero. I set the volume at a level where the beginning was barely audible. What happened next was amazing as the music built to a crescendo.
2. Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor. Because of the crazy way Amazon Music has been catalogued do not specify Bach as the composer. Specify ""by E Power Biggs"". You will experience the raw power of the Studio Echo.
My normal listening is much tamer than the above. Whenever I listen to piano music I feel that there is a grand piano in the house. No matter what genre I listen to the quality of the sound is limited only by the source quality.

When you open the box you will immediately note the very heavy duty electrical cord. This is not merely an enhancement of the Echo, although it can perform everything the Echo can, it is a radically new and powerful device.

12/6/19 update. My subscription for Amazon Music HD was implemented today. I asked Alexa to play Andrea Bocelli Si Forever. When it started to play I knew something special was happening and headed for a chair. Closing my eyes the wall near my Studio Echo disappeared and was replaced by Bocelli and the orchestra. The spread and quality of the sound was impressive to say the least. The acoustics of my living room were replaced by the acoustics of the recording studio. I was mesmerized!!!

Before signing up for Amazon Music HD you should review the system requirements if you suspect your home wifi is underpowered.",5,0.9922,Positive,344
67,"The speaker function is outstanding with absolutely great sound but unfortunately the software to make it work as a sound bar replacement isn't there yet. When connected with a mini-optical cable to a 2019 Samsung Series 8 TV, the behavior is almost possessed and I don't know if the issue is with the Echo Studio, the Samsung TV or both.

Sometimes the sound is really great but then it will suddenly just quit completely. It won't work again until you disconnect and reconnect the cables. Searching online, this seems to be a fairly common issue. Other times, the sound will suddenly become what I would describe as fuzzed or distorted. Disconnect and reconnect and it will work fine again.

My TV has a crap shoot of a time selecting the audio source when connected to the Echo Studio. Sometimes it works normally; select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out of the TV speakers. Other times, it is coming out of the Echo Studio regardless of the source selected. Select OPTICAL and it comes out the Echo Studio, select TV and it comes out both the TV speakers and the Echo Studio (slightly delayed just to be more annoying.) If connected by Bluetooth, that seems to work with both the audio and the source selection but it defeats the purpose of using the optical cable for the best sound quality.

Also, the only way to control the volume when connected with either the optical cable or Bluetooth is by using the hardware buttons on the Echo Studio. The Samsung TV doesn't recognize the Echo Studio as a known sound bar when connected to the optical cable and can't set up the remote; so no remote control of the volume. Even stranger, when connected via Bluetooth or optical, the voice commands via Alexa, while appearing to work, don't actually change the volume. When streaming music, the voice commands work perfectly.

I don't know if the problem is the the TV or the Echo Studio but the two definitely don't play nicely together. I'm hoping that a software update by one or both will finally give me the sound bar I was hoping for. I do love the sound as a speaker though. It is everything I was expecting.",3,0.8962,Positive,384

I Bluetooth paired it with my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV and I thought I was going to start watching movies with some impressive booming sound. Not only was it not booming I was barely able to hear it. The built in TV speakers had louder volume than this thing did even when I turned it to max volume. I have no problem with the ""quality"" of the sound just the lack of loudness. I'm old school. I want Top Gun the floor shaking volume. Oh, and to make matters worse the words were out of sync with the mouths moving on the screen. It's like it had some sort of bluetooth delay.

Before this last update it did sound better with that setting off. Not now! They need to do a better job getting that info out there.

It just seems like the functionality isn’t there in the app for these studio speakers.
Update! I called amazon thinking that something has to be wrong with my setup or studio speakers. After much discussion they sent two new studio speakers. I just set them up and they still sound just okay. I was replacing my echo gen 2’s with these. They sound better then the gen 2’s, but when the gen 2s have a sub paired with them they sound nearly as good as the studios.

For the price the Echo studio is just what the doctor ordered. I was looking for something small and compact that would produce really good sound. The Echo Studio does just that. I have it placed on the bottom shelf of my entertainment center and the sound is fantastic. The microphones pick up my voice OK in that location, however as with all echo products, when placed near a TV the microphones do not pick up my voice as well. I placed the Studio in another location for test purposes and found that the microphones were actually better than any other echo products I own.

I was very excited about the Surround, assuming the sound quality of the speaker would be much better than the Echo. While the base delivers, the overall sound quality is much different than I expected. I think you need to have two units or something. With just the one, it almost seems like there is a faint echo, or the music is being played from far away, even if loud. Almost like they introduced a tweak with the 3-D sound that just doesn't sound right. I think the original Echo is still my favorite. I wish I could get that device with a better speaker. Not sure if I'll return or keep, but am a bit disappointed the sound quality isn't better.

This is a severe limitation, and a deal-breaker for me. Different family members have vastly different music libraries and need to be able to connect to Studio under their own accounts. Yet this isn’t possible at this time, unless you want to de-register and re-register the speaker each and every time a new person wants to play a song from their Amazon Music account, despite being all connected on the same WiFi!

The issue I have is the Echo Studio has difficultly listen to the wake word and the command that follows. There are multiple times that I need to be at arm's length to issue the wake word. The Echo Studio right light up and then quickly disappear which left me to use the wake word again.

78,"I’m on my second Studio and have yet to be wowed. The sound is definitely better than the regular Echo but I’m having a variety of connectivity issues.

To compare, I had the HomePod for a short time before seeing info of the pending Studio release. When I first turned on the HomePod, its sound wowed me! I didn’t experience the same wowness the first time I heard the Studio.

First thing to know, which isn’t mentioned anywhere, connect Studio to your 2.4mHz network and not 5.0. Also, connect directly to your router and not through an extender. I discovered this by chance while troubleshooting connectivity problems (none of the agents thought to ask and I happened to bring it up). Not sure what you do if your Studio is upstairs and your router is downstairs and the direct signal is weak.

I returned the Studio and got a Bose 500 speaker. It sounds so much better but it’s a bit glitchy with Alexa.

I did find the aduio stopped on its own once. Overall it's worth upgrading from the echo secound Gen. I'm going to still pair with the sub because the bass could be better but I'm a audio nerd.

Update! .....Second day of using it now. I'm disappointed in the sound quality I think my echo 2nd Gen sounds just as good, I really don't hear much difference in sound quality for example treble mid and bass but the sound is louder. I would wait until they come out with the 2nd Gen on this. I'm actually pissed off! I waited over a month for this and it sounds no better than the echo 2nd Gen.

80,"Amazon really SCREWED up on this product. The sound below level 5 is just about awful. Giving more power to the smaller speakers at the lower volumes seems to be a very simple process, but they didn't do it. Also, the microphones on on TOP of the enormous speaker instead of the sides. So, since the volume has to be above five, you have to scream at the ceiling in order to be heard. They had a chance to beat the living tar out of the competition but left some serious flaws on the table. I should have waited for second generation but oh well.

UPDATE: I really HATE that the microphones are on top of the device. DO NOT buy this until Amazon fixes this serious freaking issue.

81,"Hi!,

First, I am pretty experience with WiFi, Ethernet and hard cables connections. After the third day I finally figured out the best connection.

1. I am running it off from a fire stick 4K.
2. My home internet is about 200 mbps
3. Smart tv LG 60inch uhd tv

To get Dolby Atmos surround sound Must be connected to WiFi, same network: Phone, fire stick and echo studio. Download the app, add devices then combine.

Unfortunately if you don’t have good fast WiFi, you gonna have problems. There’s is going to be a sync voice delay.. you must lips sync app on Audi settings. (Ball bouncing and and beep) Check all your apps! I had issues with YouTube, even after adjusting audio.. all other apps were good but YouTube was not working correctly, still had the delay (only app after adjustment) Netflix, Hulu and Disney worked fine.

If this is your issue, hard connect your echo studio with Toslink to Mini Toslink Digital Optical to your tv (you have to buy separate about 10 bucks) after you set up to WiFi connection from fire stick and echo studio. Then, Go to settings, audio and change it to “Audio game” setting. All your apps should be fine now, with not losing remote control adjustment volume (any other way you lose control access from remote) make sure adjust your tv with proper audio output(optical out).

I have searched forums, videos, etc. None of my devices show up when searching for devices to stereo pair. Amazon customer service is useless. They seem to have zero tech knowledge or anyone employed to deal with tech issues. They won't call back, take notes so they don't ask you the same things you tried 100x! I have wasted a bunch of time and money. Now I have to figure out how to return this junk. I wish I had room for proper powered bookshelf speakers. I hate the fire tv.

I decide where I would put this. It wound up where our Bose 500 speaker was, in the living room.

Then it mapped the room, deciding on the best sound for that room.
In one way, it is a bigger Alexa, doing everything my other Alexas do.

At very low volumes, it is less impressive. Regardless of what anyone says, no solo speaker can match the spatial environment of a stereo pair. I may wait for a second Studio around the holidays, when it might be cheaper (hint, Amazon, hint...). I had several frustrations. First is the availability and sound of the '3D' effect from Amazon Music. I could barely find any valid '3D' music outside of 5-6 3D Amazon Playlists (which all seemed to include the same very few songs). I count maybe 20 in total? If there are more, then I could not find them. C'mon Amazon, if you are all in on 3D, then start adding these!

...and there is the rub. Few songs, no new being added lately that I can find, and the complete lack of knowing if you are playing a 3D song or not. No badge labeling on the track, no clear listing of the 3D or not, and worse, if it is being played for reals, then I could not hear any difference (!). It all makes me think the Studio is not playing in the 3D mode or not. In fact, as many have noted here, the sound is more bright and present when the 3D (spatial enhancement) is turned off! I am so afraid that the '3D' mode will die a quick death and no one would even know. I would love to even be able to compare '7 Rings' with and without the 3D effect, but how can anyone know which is which without any clear labeling of the track. At this rate, the Studio will become just a 'big Echo' and all the 3D promise will be abandoned.",4,-0.3002,Negative,319

So then I tried controlling it on my phone and that's the only way I can hear sound. What's the big deal with connecting my Studios to my PC bluetooth? I really wanted this to be wireless besides with 120v plug and if this is the case then I'll just switch to the sonos. What a waste of time and money.

When playing music in stereo, Alexa says, ""nothing is playing right now"" every time I try to like or dislike a song. This shortfall has been documented previously with Amazon music, yet nothing has changed. Frankly, I like the Sonos better because there is more volume increments which benefits lower volume background music. And why can't I say ""Alexa, volume 15%"" (as opposed to one through 10).

Sure, you could plug an amp and speakers into the audio out, but then you have to either leave those powered on, or hunt around for remotes, rather than just voice command.

Quiescent power draw with the Echo Studio is about 3.6W from the wall (kill-a-watt meter). Thats about $4 a year in my location, so leaving it powered is an easy decision.

It was a bit of a pain to set it up on day one. The iphone app couldn't remap the wake word, or show volume properly. Android was fine though. The Studio itself was easy to do basic setup, even with it requiring an immediate (automatic) update.

92,"Similar to many others, we have Echos strewn throughout the house and in the living room we added the Echo Studio to the existing Fire Cube TV and Echo Dot. Originally, sound for the Fire Cube TV went through the TV via HDMI to a set of speakers. The Echo Dot was connected to a different set of speakers. I thought I could use the Echo Studio to completely replace the speakers needed. Overall, it did not work out as great as planned because of how the Echo Studio handles the 3.5mm input. It needs a certain volume level to keep it on. Frustrating when watching a program/movie and there is a quiet part and next thing you know is you missed the previous dialogue. Just plain frustrating! I'll go through my observations:

Sound was full and good enough for us and since that is subjective (know many audiophiles), it gets 5 stars. Tastes may vary.

Integration with Fire Cube TV was painful, but figured it out. Instructions/documentation was useless. We have a smart home with over 20 various smart devices (echoes, cameras, lights, etc.) and all successfully connect via Alexa, so I am well-versed in setting up devices in our environment. This was painful.

As I mentioned, I wanted to replace the external speakers and have multiple inputs into the TV, not just the Fire Cube TV. I thought the Echo Studio could be that solution for an echo device and a single speaker output for any media on the TV. With the 3.5mm,/TOS jack, it can, but with that one issue of if the volume level dips down too low, the Echo Studio just stops.

We also have the Echo Connect for our phones and whenever a call came in, we'd lose audio. For that we turn off the ""incoming Call Ringer"" under ""Sounds"" in the Alexa app for this device and many others. I have contemplated just turning on ""Do Not Disturb"" and mute this since it seems that anything that turns on the Echo Studio will interrupt the media coming from the TV.

It seems the only solution when watching media on the TV is to keep the volume up on the TV very high and manage the volume from the Echo Studio, which requires us to get up and change it. Since we are muting it, we can remote from a device, but that is too cumbersome; it's easier to just get up.

The Amazon devices in the living room are now only the Fire Cube TV and Echo Studio. Overall, it works, but that constant managing volume levels is so frustrating since at times we are watching live TV and not able to rewind 10-15 seconds. 2 stars.",2,-0.3945,Negative,454

Unfortunately I’ve passed my 30 day return window, otherwise I’d be sending the Studio back. In my experience, it fails miserably as a home theater speaker, and if your considering purchasing the Studio for that purpose - look elsewhere.

Setup of the speaker is just as easy as setting up any Echo device using the Alexa app. The demo was encouraging because the sound quality right off the bat was impressive. Setting up a home theater system and paring the speaker with the Fire TV Cube was easy as well, but it was all down hill from there. At first, there was a noticeable lip sync delay. There is a section in the Fire TV audio settings to adjust for any delay, but it seemed that I had to make that adjustment at least once a day, sometimes multiple times after switching between apps like Netflix and Hulu.

Starting about a week ago, we couldn’t any sound out of the Fire TV after turning it on. After a combination of rebooting the Cube and power cycling the Studio, we’d get sound, but the lip sync delay appeared even worse. Sometimes I’ve had to reset the network settings for the Studio in the Alexa app because it seemed like the Fire TV Cube couldn’t connect to the device, even though both were on the same wifi network. Finally, today, after dealing with the connectivity issues once again, I deleted the home theater feature from Alexa and hooked my Fire TV Cube to a Sonos Beam. Even though the sound isn’t as good (it’s still really good), the connectivity issues are gone.

104,"Another Update: I really want to emphasize that recent software updates have completely solved the problems people were reporting with the Stereo Spatial Enhancement setting. This speaker sounds phenomenal and I can't wait to get a second one for stereo pairing. Unfortunately, I waited too long to order during Prime Days so I won't get until just before Christmas. I've decided to hold off on getting the Echo Sub until after I've experienced two Studios paired together.

Update: Changed from 4 to 5 stars. I had followed other reviewers recommendations and turned the Stereo Spatial Enhancement setting off. Big mistake for my tastes. I understand that everyone has different preferences, but when I finally turned this stetting on the improvement in sound quality was immense. I figured out that when this setting is off, the top firing midrange speaker and the front firing tweeter are silenced. No idea why. When this setting is on, all speakers are producing sound, and it is pretty great. I'm now ordering a second Echo Studio to try out the stereo pairing. I'm still think the bass could be better and will probably add an Echo Sub whenever they're available again.

I really wanted to love this speaker, but that's not really the case. It certainly sounds good, but not as good as I'd hoped. I don't really listen to music at a high volume very often, and at the low to moderate volume levels I usually listen to I find the Echo 3rd generation to be more enjoyable. Now, when I do want to play something loud, the Echo Studio is great. It can get very loud and never distorts. It does require considerable tweaking of the very limited equalizer features to get the best sound. The default settings are lacking in the bass department. Once you find the settings that are right for you it sounds good. All in all it's a very good speaker, but unless you listen at higher volumes often, the Echo 3rd generation is a more affordable choice.

I have no clue how all these reviews are having problems with pairing and creating groups and so on and so forth first of all. I have a ton of echo devices and they all play nice with the Studio.

I've had Samsung soundbars, 5.1 surround sound systems, and have been around the Sonos Beam and Playbar. All I can say is this thing ROCCCKKKKKSSSSS. The sound is incredible. Absolutely incredible. It as a stand alone speaker blows away any similarly priced sound bar or speaker for music and even TV watching. Sorry for those of you who overpaid for the Sonos playbar as well, because it rivals that at a third of the cost. The Atmos sound is incredible on a single unit hooked up through my 4k Fire Stick, but one unit isn't enough for the ultimate experience. So, I just ordered a second one to go on each side of the TV. (While it sounds amazing by its onesy, you really should pair them if you're going to use them for a TV setup. That was not my original intention when bought but I was so happy with it now I just have to.)

Amazon really knocked this out of the park. I was iffy on the sound from the new gen Echos and not very happy with the sound for price really, so I was hesitant on expectationsfor the Studio. (I have two echos and like 8 dots....and Echo Autos, and Echo buds.....yeah I'm a slave to Amazon at this point....), but the Studio just killed the competition. Sorry Sonos.

Will update if necessary when I get the second one. If it wasn't for the Mrs. hating too much bass I would pair it with the Echo sub, but this thing has enough bass on its own. Cant wait to get the second one, pair them, and condemn the sound bar to the garage......

It's on for much of the day while listening to Sirius XM, Pandora or Amazon Music.
Now for the good, the bad and suggestions for Amazon.
The good:
- It worked out of the box and was effortless to set up (other than with the Fire TV 4k).
- Was reasonably attractive and solidly built.
- The bass response went fairly deep and sounded good on the right material.
- It had enough power to sound ""punchy"" when it needed to.
The bad:
- The 3D effect was non-existent to my ears. I tried the speaker in four different locations (even though is was destined to be in the kitchen).
- The sound quality was not pleasing on most material. This could potentially be corrected if the EQ was expanded from three-band to ten-band. While determining this, I gave the most weight for sonic quality to songs delivered in Ultra HD from Amazon Music since the Sirius XM material is pretty compressed.
- The volume level was never quite right when using the 1 -10 scale. Even using the Alexa app to control it was a pain. Sometimes it did not remember the setting when exiting the app. I don't understand why Amazon can't expand the volume option to either 1 - 100 percent or allowing .5 settings (i.e. ""Alexa: Set the volume to 2.5"", or ""Alexa: Set the volume to 25%"" ). This also hold true for the Echo speaker (as others have voiced online). For my needs, 2.5 or 3.5 (depending on time of day and the music source) are perfect, but going into the Alexa app to change it is not convenient.
- I could not get it to work with the Fire TV 4k.
- The spatial enhancement for stereo music is awful. Just turn it off immediately (it is only available with the latest update for the Alexa app).
- As noted by another reviewer, the blue light is not visible is many placements like it is on the standard Echo. I tried using the audible notification (available in the settings), but it was obnoxious.
My suggestions for Amazon:
- Make the EQ ten bands, not three
- Add more granularity to the voice activated volume adjustments.
- Market it as a full range Alexa enabled speaker with an included hub - not a ""surround sound"" speaker where it fails miserably. Sell that as a bonus feature.
- Improve the quality of the high frequencies. Not sure if it's the tweeter or the amp, but the high end could use some help to produce a more pleasing sound.
I returned it after one week... but would likely have kept it if it had the expanded EQ and ability to voice control the volume in finer increments.",3,0.913,Positive,559
108,"So I installed two of these on the back porch out by the pool along with an echo sub that I had in my family room previously. Before this I had two original Echo Plus speakers on the back porch. The difference is night and day. My neighbors agree LOL. I do wish that the power cords were longer and I wish that the speakers were louder than they are at Max , maybe 50% more would be perfect. But regardless I'm very happy. I would put them inside as well but I have 2 home theater setups one of my family room and one in my man cave and these speakers would pale in comparison to what I already have there. Might consider getting another set for my garage though. If I decide to I will update this review later.",5,0.9516,Positive,141
109,"I've always been someone who listens to music very consistently, sometime weeks have been legit 24/3
Then there was a time where I stopped even having the interest of listening to music.
Then i listened to music with 2 echo studios paired and It automatically moved my soul back into listening to music, it even had me subscribe to Spotify for the 1st time

The sound quality is something else with these 2, i carry one around my home and balcony with ease.

So the positive of these are the sound quality, absolutely magical.

The negatives are the annoying faulty pairing speed and faultiness it has.
Alone, it's fine, sounds great.
But if you're interested in surround sound, rich music, it is an annoyance.

I constantly have to figure out how to re-pair them together to play on Spotify.
2 ECHO STUDIOS WILL NOT PLAY MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH

They connect through wifi to each other and play through a service like Spotify, Amazon music, and some other ones. If you have a default player, youtube, or an app like Calm, etc, you won't be able to listen to both at the same time for some strange, annoying reason.

Randomly they will pair together or unpair in the middle of the night or any time. Again, when wanting to play a song, you can't just have a song pop up tap the song you want to play and listen to it.
You have to literally do troubleshooting everytime you want to play it in paired mode and through Spotify in my experience.

If that wasn't an issue, this sound system would be an easy 5 star. Regardless, I'm going to buy them again because the audio is that good and hope that updates will fix the issue.

I bought 2 JBL Flip 5 speakers to compare.
In sound, there's no comparison.
With those it's around 200$ for both, smaller, and pair easily and can play through Bluetooth, which means you can play through any music player most likely.
Sound wasn't bad, but it really made the Echoes sound even better when comparing.",2,0.9951,Positive,351

The published solution is to push the microphone button which unmutes the microphone which I’ve somehow muted. But when I push the button for four seconds she searches for a WiFi network. I bought Alexa to listen to me and despite my considerable research and pressing all of her buttons in various combinations the ring of red light remains. Sad. I feel rejected.

I have five of these Echo speakers scattered about the house and yard but looking to complete my living room stereo system. Sounded pretty good out of the box till I paired it with my Echo Plus and began to notice the obvious difference in sound quality in the upper range. The Studio Alexa voice has a distinctively tinny sound compared to the Echo Plus. Strike one. Strike two was the erratic response behavior...that one’s a little more subtle and a bit more difficult to pin down. Not exactly sure why, but it seems to lag or sometimes didn’t respond at all. Could not really detect any benefit to the 3D FX and the bass response isn’t all that great at lower volumes. I already have the Echo Sub-Woofer which I HIGHLY recommend. So, why do I need this thing? UPDATE: I just added my new Echo Plus 3rd Gen to the living room stereo group and the quality is exceptional.

114,"I have had echo devices since the original. I purchased this speaker from Best Buy last holiday and have been using it for approaching 11 months. I have a mixture of Shows and Echos and Dots and the one Studio throughout my house. I have held off on a review in hopes that the problems with the speaker would have been fixed, but they never have been.

The sound quality is great when it works.

Initially the setup literally broke all of the connected devices voice functionality in my house. The integrated bridge wanted to rediscover every individual device instead of using the existing bridge everything was connected to. Maybe I did something wrong but I set everything back up and it sucked but it was fine.

Initially it seemed to work well and the sound quality was great. This was followed by 11 month of absolute unreliability.

At least twice a week I will come in and the speaker is unresponsive and lighting up like it’s looking all around and never working. The microphone array, which at first was by far the best out of all the echoes I have at picking up through loud music and talking quietly, almost never works.

I can be in my living room and say Alexa and be 3 feet from the studio and it will light up but never respond to anything unless I unplug it and plug it back in and then it will work for a little while before it has the same problems again. I talk a little louder and the old Dot I have in my bedroom down a hall and through a wall will come on and respond while this guy just puts on a random light show. It is not connectivity issues, it’s about 10 feet away from a new high end router which has been upgraded since I had the thing with the same problems.

I was expecting a big leap in clarity/presence, etc. So far, no leap. Now, I was coming from a 1st Gen Amazon Echo, which, I think, probably had the better sound when compared to the subsequent generations, so maybe the gap was narrower. I also have an Echo Sub, and I've tried the Studio both with, and without, the sub. Eh. It's in my kitchen on the corner of a counter, I did the setup, etc. The sub is across the room on the floor, tucked into a corner. I don't have Zigbee devices, so no review of the built-in Zigbee hub. Perhaps if I'd ordered 2 of these, and paired them in stereo with the sub and was using them with my FireTV for home theater sound, I'd be impressed. As it is, while the sound is fine and probably as-good as it was with my old Echo, I'm relatively underwhelmed at this point. Hence my 3 stars.",3,0.5934,Positive,187

I listen to classical, 60s -70's Rock, Grunge, singer songwriter, all sound great.

Currently I have it set on the floor near a wall in our family room and the sound is fantastic - fills the room and even sounds great from the adjoining kitchen. I tweaked the EQ settings in the app a bit, which I have also done for all of my other devices which enable that option. I thought the size would be something I would have a hard time dealing with, but it is actually much more adaptable to just about any place than I thought. I have not tried pairing it with one of my Fire TV Cubes yet, but will get to that later.

Tried emailing support 4 times, no answer, because there is not one and Amazon does not care to provide a simple fix. The only work around is to switch off the microphone and not set it up in a group. If you are not going to use it as a smart speaker, there are much better sound bar speaker options out there.

The studio does seem to carry a bit farther than the plus and the voice recognition is far superior. I do wish I had bought the 3rd gen echo along with the studio so I could compare and see if there is a true 100 dollar difference. I would say that the echo plus and the studio sound a lot alike. Also, I could not pair my studio to any of my other echo devices. I made sure the firmware was updated and even removed all devices from multi room music thinking they couldn't be paired due to the fact they were part of another music group. Didn't help.

Initial setup
- like any Echo product setup was a breeze, if you already have the alexa app most of the time if you order online the echo product is already linked to your account.
- the startup sound gave me goosebumps, i couldn't believe the depth of sound that this speaker produces
- Playing music sounded great, Echo studio has some great lows, mids, and highs. Clarity is perspective you can work with the equalizer to get a bit more clarity however since i have several Echo dots spaced out in my house the Echo studio does a great job with filling the room.
-voice recognition is great even though i have it sitting above my cabinet space in my kitchen. the Echo Studio often here me prior to the the Echo Show 5 in my kitchen.

You will love this speaker, its was more versatile than the Apple Home Pod( this coming from a person that has Apple everything in my home) smarter and more effective. save yourself the extra hundred dollars and get this speaker. you will not regret your purchase",5,0.9945,Positive,252
126,"Updated: This thing is so weird, but wonderful when it clicks. Positioning seems vital. By accident I found that *under* my coffee table in my very windowed back porch somehow works amazingly for 3D music. Abbey Road was like having the Beatles doing a private concert in my back porch. Seriously. And really weird: they were standing on the opposite side of the Echo from me playing towards me. Crazy, amazing positioning. I could sense how tall John was as he sang and played to me. One of the best music reproduction experiences I've ever had. Keeping it. Sound quality was kinda loose, but good enough. My main stereo is Linn and Paradigm positioned well and doing room correction for my listening position. That set up is way better than the Echo for sheer quality. But that 3D imaging of the Echo was crazy, and the loose quality of the sound fed into that sense of a live concert, like a small club with questionable sound, the real deal. Maybe a fancy Atmos set up would sound better with the same 3D effect, but I'm not going mess with success and I'll leave the Echo in this horrible spot that somehow makes it kill.

Original review:
Throws gross special effects at the sound, which 80% of the time are horrible, like a 14 year-old discovering makeup. It works freakishly well for solo classical guitar recordings, but that's not enough for me to keep it. Bands/rock becomes a huge mess, like an amateur juggler trying to practice new moves and doing them badly. The spacial enhancement feature is really awful most of the time, it seems to just put a ton of bad reverb and delay on there to seemingly try to make things sound grandiose and epic. It might work for someone's taste, I like my music playback equipment to help me hear what the musician and producers intended, not what a computer science major playing with new functions wants to play with. I'll leave my audio equipment to the pros, not to Amazon. I did not test it for Dolby Atmos, maybe it works as a fairly cheap movie soundbar kind of thing. It's fine for background music at low volume. But for focused listening, it's mostly a mess. Plus, I hate the lights, distraxcting. There might be a way to turn them off. Oh, the Alexa app-Amazon Music-Echo integration is great.",4,0.9323,Positive,403

The Alexa voice volume is extremely low and not in alignment with the music play back so when your listening to music you can not hear the Alexa voice.

I figured I would try the Echo Studio because of the 3d Music... and I have to say I am IMPRESSED. I believe that these speakers sound better than the Sony's which is a pretty high bar. I agree that the Studio is the best sounding Echo speaker... but I believe that is really low bar, considering that the other speakers seem to be to get a audio assistant to the market... which I believe that Amazon has done a great job in doing that. The things that I really like about this speaker is that it is a true audiophile speaker, great frequency range even in the low end. I think as a assistant it works alot better then the other Amazon speakers (it understands when your talking to it), Even when not listening to a 3d track it sounds 3d because the spatial enhancement it provides depth, it is relatively small with a huge sound 330 watts, without distortion... if you have this speaker try listening to Beyonce's Homecoming Album with the Volume turned up ALOT!!!

Tried playing a different song using Bluetooth. Didn't sound distorted, but gave me no reason at all to spend $199 on what I thought would be a noticeable upgrade from my Echo Plus. I played this song through my Echo Plus, too, just to be sure.

I suppose the bass must be louder, which would satisfy some people who don't know the different between the bass being louder and high fidelity. But actually it wasn't even noticeably bassier to me. Anyway, I'm looking for clarity and definition, not more bass, and I was disappointed.

Please be aware that I think that the 2 studios and subwoofer are amazing together. The sound is outstanding, my only setback is that I can't connect a bluetooth record player to the group to listen. I can only listen on one of the studios, and no sub. I am hoping that this is something that amazon fixes in the future...

So I had a regular Fire tv that worked fine, we recently purchased 2 amazon alexa studios (amazing sound! kudos amazon!) and a subwoofer. well amazon got us on the hook for an additional $90.00 because we couldn't connect the group to the fire tv, we needed to upgrade to the 2nd gen cube. FINE, we move the tv into our bedroom lol.
Fast forward, well we watch a lot of shows on amazon video, hulu, and sling. MOSTLY recorded things, sound and function 5+ stars! We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.
So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.
Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.
In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this?

I wanted to return, but Amazon makes you talk to Customer Service before you can send it back and it takes awhile to go through all the ""tips and tricks"" on this device they want you to try. i'd wait till they get the bugs ironed out.",1,-0.5194,Negative,93

I was going to get a soundbar system for twice the price. With this device I have less wires, one less remote, plus Alexa. Was watching my favorite scenes from the Star Wars movies to test it out and I was blown away. Keep in mind I have it plugged in through the optical port on my tv so it functions as a soundbar, but in that regard it is an excellent device. Music and podcasts sound great as well. Of course this will not satisfy someone who requires the full blown theatre experience but for the price and lack of messy cables and wire, one can't go wrong if they want to enhance weak tv speakers.

142,"I bought a pair of these on sale to use as a home theater speaker system. The fact that they're wireless (except for power cord), support Dolby Atmos, and are relatively inexpensive were selling points for me. I've got them paired with a 4K FireTV Stick and when the system works, it sounds great. Unfortunately, they just don't always work. There will be times when there's just no audio. It seems completely random. I'll be watching a show, fast-forward through a scene and when replay starts, there will be no audio. Sometimes I have to completely unpair the entire system in the Alexa app and re-setup the entire system to get it to work again. Sometimes, one channel will cut out. I regularly have audio glitches when streaming from my local Fire TV Recast. At other times, it's flawless. I have my network router settings optimized for streaming for all these devices. I have a decently fast connection (~60Mbs down/20 up) and don't have any issues streaming when not using these speakers.

The other downside is that the system only works when I'm using my Fire TV stick. There are no inputs for media players, game machines, or other devices.

This did not live up to the hyper at all. Hook was fairly simply and straight forward as Amazon has mastered this process through the great integration with the Alexa app (at least on iOS). The sound was not nearly as good as I expected and I ultimately sent both back. Trust me, I really wanted this to be great but it was at best so-so. If you're looking for stereo sound I would stick with getting two cheaper priced Echo or Echo Plus and calling it a day.",2,0.9403,Positive,121
144,"We bought the first generation Echo along with a couple of Echo Dots four years ago and have been using it in the kitchen. It took some counter space but was not really in the way. The sound was decent, much better than the Echo Dots. I wanted some better sound. I looked at the Studio along with a couple of high end speakers with Alexa capability. The issues with Alexa performance noted in the reviews of the high end speakers turned me off on them. We use Alexa a lot and I didn't want something that didn't work well with it. I thought the specs on the Studio looked good so I decided to try it.

I love it when Amazon puts things on sale. The Cyber Monday price was really good. Unfortunately, it was back ordered and couldn't get here by Christmas. It came a couple of days ago. I opened the box with great anticipation. I moved the first generation Echo and put this in it's place. It was overwhelming on the kitchen counter. My wife really didn't like it there. We have a split level house where the family room is down stairs from the kitchen. There is an open space in the family room wall into the kitchen. We decided to put the Studio on the desk in the family room. Problem solved!

The Studio sound is night and day different from the Echo. It's like comparing a tricycle to a sports car. The Studio sound is not only powerful enough to fill the family room and the kitchen. At full volume, it will fill the whole house!

A setup comment. The Alexa app asked me which room the speaker was in. I originally had it in the kitchen. I told it kitchen. I didn't realize that it had created a group called kitchen and put all my echo devices in that group. I have a smart switch named kitchen. Alexa could not turn that switch on and off. When I realized that the group was conflicting, I removed it and the problem was solved. I don't know why it asks for a room. Other Echo devices don't do that.

There are adjustments in the Alexa app for base, mid-range and treble. I have read where some have complained that this is inadequate. I don't claim to be an audiophile. I do appreciate good sound. My favorite place to listen to music has been in my Mercedes which has a really nice sound system. My new favorite is becoming the kitchen and family room.

This may not be a Sonos or Bose name brand and I don't have their speakers to compare. This is an excellent product and sounds amazing! It's price is very attractive. I highly recommend the Echo Studio.",5,0.9956,Positive,466
145,"As a stand alone unit, this thing is great. Awesome sound, just enough bass and crisp highs. Does everything all the other Echos do as far as Alexa goes. Where the problems come in at, is when you try using it as a home theater for your tv. I have never yelled so much at a tv before in my life. I was using a Bose Cinemate 15 for a few years. It worked great, sounded good and paired nice with my Harmony remote. When the Echo Studio came out with the Home Theater feature, I swapped out my Bose and added the Echo Studio and paired it with my Fire 4k stick and the Echo Sub. Right from the start nothing worked as it should. I could hear the sub, but nothing coming out from the studio. It played a “home theater test video” and all I could hear was the sub and the video was in slow motion. After unpairing and repairing everything a couple times, it finally worked...for a couple days. I stream my tv from YouTube tv and if you fast forward, pause, rewind any video the lip sync is way off. I went into the settings and tried the lip sync adjustments. It worked until the bedtime you fast forward, rewind ect. Then you would have to do it all over again or restart the fire tv. Lately the volume has been going up and down on its own. The remote is super laggy sometimes for the volume adjustment. I have tried moving my wifi router closer and farther with no effect. All my devices say they have excellent wifi signal. It seems like it takes me about 15-20 mins of troubleshooting to finally be able to watch tv every time I want to watch tv. I finally had enough with it and hooked up my Bose Cinemate 15 and got rid of the Echo Studio. As far as the Studio playing music, it sounds great and functions as it should. If you plan on using it for your home theater, stay far away from this thing. I can’t say if it’s a problem with the studio itself or all echos that have the home theater option because I’ve only tried it with the studio and a echo sub. Maybe it works fine all by itself, but once paired with another echo device I had nothing but problems.",2,0.9849,Positive,403

If your looking for a home audio system and want to integrate any other device this will not work BY DESIGN! Thats literally the silliest audio device ive ever encountered. Unless you listen solely to amazon music and use alexa this is nothing more than a paper weight. Also customer service was useless in trying to exchange for another system.

149,"Ok sounding unit. Not sure it’s worth the price. I won’t attempt to listen in 3D or HD as I’m not going to want to spend the extra later. Huge volume differences between services, but could be the service. Seems to have to be turned up high to get decent sound. In an apartment living room that’s about 17 feet long by 15 wide. Alone it’s sound isn’t that loud (or great) Crazy thing that when linked with an echo dot 3rd gen, it fills room better (the studio on far end of room, the dot on the opposite end, studio at volume 5, dot volume 6). One of my peeves of this whole echo system is equalizer settings and volume settings come and go.

I do hear some depth using tune in as my streaming service. It’s better than the dot alone obviously,but without the dot, it seems a bit blah. I understand the other reviews about it being kind of vocal lacking.

I don’t plan on using it in a home theater type st up as I already have a bose sound bar I’m quite content with that sounds better than this unit. Similar prices also.

I do enjoy linking my five devices (studio, regular echo gen 3, and three dots around the apartment) for full apartment music. Might be the only reason I keep the studio as I’m not that much of a fan. It’s kind of well, unimpressive, but gives a little extra “oomph” to the whole bunch together.

As far as Bluetooth, I find it painful to pair versus any other Bluetooth device. I’ll probably only use it for streaming services and use my Bluetooth speakers for that purpose. This applies to all my echos.

I’ve never listened to a Sonos or the expensive Apple speaker, so I haven’t a clue what to compare it to. I’ve been more impressed by Bluetooth speakers that I have when I first heard them. I’ve had a few by the likes of bose, ue, and Soundcore.

When it comes to speakers, the echo studio is ok. I’ll keep it because of the alexa operation, but have heard better. There’s not a huge “wow” factor for me. Very surprised it’s not better claiming 330 watts.

After buying I see that a paired system is what really works, which frustrates me because Amazon marketed as a lower price alternative to Sonos, but if I have to buy two, then I’m right within the Sonos range. Amazon should be more obvious about the paired system as the “immersive experience”. One by itself doesn’t cut it.",3,-0.6854,Negative,98

==============
Technical Support phoned me only one day after I made the post below. “Tammi” seemed genuinely concerned that I was having problems and was very, very patient as we went through a detailed factory reset and reconnection to my network. The Studio is working MUCH better now.

Very impressed with a quick and unsolicited response from Technical Support one day after the original post. Thank you, “Tammi!”

=========

This Alexa device disappointed me. After installing two original Amazon Echo devices several years ago and then three Echo Dots in various places around the house I was quite excited when I got my Echo Studio. I envisioned full and rich sounds of music for my small home office. Not.

While the Echo Studio sounds good (but not great) the Studio sucks hugely at hearing. You have to speak your requests louder than normal and you have to keep your request words clear-and-seperated-from-each-other or Studio will just sit there like a big round rock. I think the microphone(s) are either ill-placed or I have a defective unit. I wish I could simply ""turn up the microphones.""

Very frustrating, especially after being used to a near-perfect Dot for a couple of years in the very same location.

I am so sorry that I did not throughly test my Studio on arrival when I could have returned it for a refund. I'm stuck with it now. Bought from Best Buy because Amazon was so terribly backordered.

My old Echos have always worked well but frankly the dots work best of all. I actually have a small Marley powered speaker plugged into one of the dots. It sounds great. Compared to the studio it sounds fantastic and it ""hears"" much, MUCH better.

Beware.",4,0.9763,Positive,292
153,"Those of you that have read my reviews know that I tell it like it is. Most echo device users, who listen to music complain that none of the echo devices are capable of reproducing bass notes properly. I say, if you wanted bass, then add the echo sub to your current device or change up all together. I currently run 9 echo devices in my home. I wanted to have music throughout my home and not miss a beat of a song. I purchased the echo studio for my garage, yes, that’s correct, my garage. The only place in my home that needs the sound louder, and the ability to have a bit more bottom end. This device not only provides me with incredible sound, I was able to get it on prime day for $150. I most likely would have paid $199 as it’s well worth it. It uses tone frequencies to measure the distance within a room so that it can control the amount of volume to each speaker. Upon setup which takes about 2 minutes, I was ready to add it to my everywhere group. Most audio enthusiasts could agree, for the price, this device exceeds expectations as its design allows for a rich full room of sound where most speakers fail. I was using a high end portable Bluetooth speaker for awhile, and hated the fact I had to run it through my phone. Every time phone rang, it interrupted my music. Each and every alert was pushed through the speaker. I got tired of this and opted to go echo. This was truly the best device for the garage. Truly satisfied with the sound quality, loudness.

Not only can I listen to music, but I can control every smart device I have connected to it. Be smart people, never add locks, or garage door openers to your echo devices. If you do, change it to some unusual name. Figured I would add that!",5,0.9585,Positive,329
154,"This speaker puts out some excellent sound from such a small package - when it decides to put out sound.

Setup was easily as always with Amazon devices, and after a quick google I paired with a fire tv stick 4k. Now that it was ready to go, I wanted to try listening to music on it. Tell Alexa to play music ... nothing. Try again ... nothing. Try command I've used on my other Echo ... nothing. I went on the spotify app and selected play music to the Echo Studio, and finally, excellent, rich sound. 15 minutes of a playlist going, and then audio stops. Start music again from the spotify app, everything is great, until a few songs later and audio stops.

I also connected a toslink from the TV to the Echo Studio line-in. Turn on the TV, and the Echo Studio switches to playing audio from the TV ... until it decides to stop playing all audio. I could not find any commands to get audio back up again. Turn off the TV and back on, and great, it's fixed, and 20 minutes later ... you get the picture.

Alexa's voice also had a weird glitch where she would speak in a extremely slow stutter. Not all of the time, just randomly.

The Echo studio produces clear, room filling sound with respectable base. If you're looking for stereo sound, get two, as a single just can't replicate a stereo set up.

I would love to love it, but it is just not there yet. I hope Amazon can figure out these glitches as the Echo Studio is a great speaker at a good price.",2,0.9871,Positive,279
155,"We had 2 Sonos One speakers for a few years now, and TBH we've loved them in terms of sound quality... but their Alexa integration, however was lacking in one critical feature - being able to join the Alexa ""everywhere"" group for when we had parties or are doing things around the house.

We like to be able to move room to room and have the same music... it's just nice to be able to clean and jam out house-wide. We do the same for parties - lower music in every room is so much nicer than loud music in a few areas.

This closes the bridge a bit between normal Alexa's (not great sound) with the Sonos Ones (great sound with tech limitations). The one big downfall is that this is 1.5x as big, approximately, as the Sonos One. Had we had the Sonos:1 instead, we'd have just gotten some Echo Input devices and called it a day, but they made these without input ports, so that was off the table as well.

Let's talk about cost - full price currently is VERY expensive - more than the Sonos devices. If the Alexa integration isn't important to you, go with the Sonos model - smaller profile, still works great, etc. I'd not spend the extra on the Sonos One - just get the Sonos:1 or the Sonos:5",4,0.9848,Positive,228

Are they the best speakers in the whole world? No. Are they the second best speakers in the whole world? No. But they're pretty good speakers nonetheless. I'd them a 5 for set up, versatility and ease-of-use. And far as sound quality probably a 4.5. The only thing I have to compare them to are my edifier 1000's. And although I like the edifier's better, this speaker's sound quality is not that far off from them. I mainly wanted the speaker to put in the living room and I really like that I can group it with my family room edifier speakers (that are hooked up to an echo Dot through a cable) and the sound is loud and clear throughout the house. On their own I think they would benefit from having a sub paired to two of them, but a single unit still sounds really good. One other reason for not giving them a five is that I just can't believe that these are 330 Watts. I would guess more like 90 to 100 Watts, but they're loud enough none the less. I also tried it outside for a bit and I know they are loud enough to irritate your neighbors if that's what you want.

I gave it 4 stars due to the hype, hyped way to high as it just sounds slightly better than the echo plus, which i can't connect because Amazon support said i need to purchase the next generation model. That won't happen. I think for $199.00 that's swaying me from buying 2 of these as the Sonos Play1s sound 10 times better even though the echo studio touts the other music protocols.

If it would have sounded like the hype said it did it would have been an easy 5 stars but to be honest i was slightly let down but no big deal, Amazon is an awesome company and it's a decent/good speaker that won't connect to my other Amazon devices.",4,0.9665,Positive,138

I purchased this thinking that this device would be a standalone device without needing an Echo Sub, but I was wrong. In order to get that nice thick & rich sound, it is absolutely necessary to pair your studio up with a sub, which means $$$.

Echo 2 or 3 + Echo Sub ==> much better sound than Echo Studio.
Echo Studio + Echo Sub is MUCH BETTER than Echo Studio.
Echo Studio is better than Echo 3 - but not by much.

160,"Update 02/07/2020, it's been early January that I returned this speaker...Amazon called me within hours of this review and offered to talk to me about my problem so they could send the details to the developers. Nice touch Amazon. Today I called Amazon a 3rd time asking where my refund is after being told 2 previous times wait another 3-5 days. The customer service person never once answered 1 question I asked several time...what is the hold up?! Then told me have a nice day, good bye, and hung up. Good job Amazon, you're losing a 10+ year Prime member.

First of all, the build-quality and sound-quality are top notch. For its' size, this speaker really does produce a great sound. I've owned countless Bluetooth speakers, and this one delivered on sound.

But I'm all about functionality, and this speaker did not deliver on that. I used this speaker in my bedroom for TV sound and to play Spotify (which I do constantly). I have my Mac Mini connected to my TV and have the Echo connected via Bluetooth to my Mac Mini. For a few weeks it performed flawlessly...playing my Spotify when I fired up a playlist, and automatically connecting back to my Mac Mini when I closed out of Spotify. This would be the first Alexa device I've used that functioned properly. One night while watching a movie, the sound dropped out and the speaker disconnected from Bluetooth...now showing up as offline in the Alexa app. From this point on the issues just got progressively worse.

So I've given up on Amazon speakers except for my old Echo Plus (with the rotating volume ring) because it still functions 100% and I've never had to reconnect it to my network.

I am now back to my UE Boom 2 speakers...that when powered up automatically connect to my Mac Mini as they should and simply function. The sound quality is nothing like the Echo Studio, but at least it does what it's supposed to without fail.

It probably works fine as a standalone Echo device, but I purchased as part of a home theater setup with another Studio, for stereo pairing along with an Echo Sub, and a FireTV cube. And each of these devices probably work just fine in a standalone configuration. (Well, the Sub has to be paired with a compatible speaker.) Together as a home theater setup they produced plenty of disappointment and frustration.

Issues:
* Echo Studio music - ""Sorry, I am having trouble playing music"" - happened on and off. When it worked, it sounded good. When it didn't, how it sounds doesn't matter.
* Echo Studio home theater - when the Studios decided to work, there were occasional audio drop outs. Every day after adding the Sub and trying to watch more content, there was no audio from the Studios, just thump and bass from the Sub. I would try to play music to see if something would come out and no go (see above). Other times I could get it to play music and then playing a movie would have sound.

I followed troubleshooting steps found at Amazon and online forums, even setting up a dedicated wifi router (Synology RT2600AC) four feet from the devices. Tried 5Ghz, 2.4GHz, FireTV Cube wireless and/or direct connected using Ethernet adapter, and a number of other reconfiguration steps, unpair/re-repair, unplug/plug in, restart, etc. So, everything is going back.

163,"Update: After what feel is unnecessary investigations online, and turning off the awful stereo spatial audio setting which is on by default, the quality and lost layers issue was resolved and general music sounded much better - and at a lower volume - making Alexa’s quiet voice less of an issue. However this hits the 3D audio files a bit as they sounded, less ideal than they would have otherwise. I’m not going to bounce in and out of the app for this setting. Also there's no way this setting should be on by default with it in the state it is currently in. Inexcusable to not screen all formats/genres of music before pushing out a device with a feature that is not advertised.

Alexa’s voice on this device, however (as well as comms) is still far too low. We still need the ability to set these independently from one another if there is going to be these kinds of balancing issues depending on the device type. Was going to provide a slight bump to the score, but this is still bothersome however that using as a basic Alexa device is hamstrung by the audio mixing. A good quality for the $ speaker that is just seemingly going to waste.

I gave this a full on shot, tried various music types and the lot, and with many of the non-classical and traditional rock tracks, such as pop and electronic music, a lot of layers, elements, and specifically - vocals - were drowned out by the “rest” of the music. This even occurred in the 3D branded tracks, in where undoubtedly the vocal layer is far too squashed. It sounds great, it’s just uneven. Even Alexa’s voice itself is shockingly way too low compared to the music, and any call to another Echo device, is barely audible unless cranked up. If you have any intention of buying this as an Alexa speaker with improved audio - do consider the unbalanced nature of the audio itself. Overall this product is a disappointment. I also do not own a Fire TV Cube so I will never have the ambition to get a second for Dolby Atmos, unless it’s more broadly supported (which it is not).

To be honest, this studio seems to be roughly just as loud as our old Echo. The bass is a bit deeper, and the mid-range seems to be a touch clearer, but we honestly don't notice much of a difference.
My biggest heart break with this studio is the voice recognition. Now our original Echo wasn't perfect, where we had to re-say ""Alexa"" a few times here and there to get it to pick up. But this studio is simply awful. We constantly need to re-say ""Alexa"" to get it to wake up. Once it's woken up, there is about a 15% chance that it simply doesn't pickup your command and it just does nothing. My assumption (without any research done prior), is that 5 years would have provided advancements in their microphone technology based on all of the different echo devices.

We realize the Studio is not weatherproof so most of the time, we use it in our family room which has our kitchen, dining, and living area. We also have two Alexas and the Subwoofer working together for stereo. We put this in the middle to add more midrange and it works great! Years ago, we had a huge speaker system with giant subs, etc. I do believe, this delivers better sound quality at a variety of volumes and is completely unobtrusive. Of note is that, when we first received the Studio, I connected it to the Subwoofer and used the other two Alexas for stereo. Evidently, when the Studio and Sub are connected together, they balance out the bass between them and it took way too much bass away from the Subwoofer. When I went back to the original configuration above, it sounded much better. I renamed the Studio to 'Echo' so we don't have three Alexas replying to everything we ask.

I have a Sonos Beam (an integrated center channel, Alexa-enabled streaming speaker) which is a great option as well -- but for more money and a much larger footprint it should be.

The Studio is a bit unusual looking -- but my goal is what it sounds like. And when it wails it does so very well. I don't tinker with 3D sound -- seems like a gimmick to me -- but the truth is I think the sound quality is more than adequate just streaming Spotify, Pandora and whatever else you might find to be worth playing. The main issue I find is that when it's rolling it doesn't respond well to Alexa voice commands. Worse, when I ask Alexa for track info for a song that's playing, the response is too quiet to be audible and requires a repeat or tinkering with the volume. So either the music itself is too loud or the interruption -- eg ""Alexa, who is this?"" -- is too quiet. Frustrating.

Given this is a relatively new product, it's acceptable but still something I would prefer to have already been resolved.

The good news is I had no problems integrating this in my smart switches at home -- lighting, my Dyson air purifier, my alarms, etc. -- and that was a plus. I'd definitely buy this again and have no qualms recommending it to potential buyers. I also like the fact the Alexa app allows users to customize their sonic experience. A work in progress, and I believe it will improve -- right now it's not quite there but even if it stays as is I am glad I added this to my home setup.",4,0.9942,Positive,336

169,"I listen to wide variety of music and this is a perfect addition to my other Echo’s from the smallest to the medium one and this has come on December 24th and it took exactly 70 days to arrive. I have a very nice speaker system that I bought years back and they don’t make them any more so I wanted to add yet another choice to my arsenal of sounds in my life. The Beats by Dr. Dre is 7 yrs old but it packs the best punch for $400 that I paid for it many moons ago and still going strong. What the Amazon Echo has going for it is the price and I love the 3D sound on this bad boy. I’ve had all of 1 day or 10 hours and here I am writing about it because this unit really got my ears and emotions that goes with the music I listen to into a great vibe. People that write bad reviews on this must have $10,000 plus dollar systems in their homes and this just didn’t cut it for them. My Harmon Kardon in the BMW M3 was amazing and there is no comparison but come on guys, for the money and for what it does, sale or not sale, this is a bargain all day long!! Jeff Bezos is an extremely smart person and he made sure items like this have very good quality control and he has been selling great products beyond this speaker system and Amazon is one incredible company for sure. Anyway, enough of me bragging about a company I don’t have stocks in and don’t get paid to write reviews. Thank you for reading and I hope you too have a good experience with this product.",5,0.9957,Positive,296
170,"Total let down. The sound quality is great but the movie and tv audio sync issues kills the entire product. Don’t even bother getting this unless you want to just listen to music or Until they can fix the video audio sync issues cause if you’re using anything other than amazon and Netflix videos it will already be out of sync.

I got it hooked up home theater mode to a 2nd gen cube and it ONLY plays audio in sync from Amazon and Netflix videos. Any other app and the audio is out of sync right from the start (twitch, YouTube, philo, Hulu, showtime, HBO, Disney+ etc) and there’s no way to fix it because the lip sync setting in settings doesn’t help. This is clearly a software issue and not hardware (customer service will tell you it’s hardware and to restart the firetv).",2,0.6187,Positive,145
171,"They will only hook up through WiFi...when they hook up. The whole process was exhausting and in the end? They kinda suck. Timing mismatch from one streaming platform to the next, horrible drop offs while streaming. And... you can't leave your Fire TV hard wired while using them. There is just no flexibility with these things... very disappointed. I returned them and would not recommend for any kind of TV audio experience.",1,-0.9378,Negative,72
172,"What I like: The bass on this rocks. I even had to bring it down. This thing is loud! Super easy setup. I like that this could serve as a decent sound bar. The 3D songs are awesome but I will say that placement of the speaker is important i.e. center of a square room with the speaker facing you.

What I don’t like that much: I would like the highs and mids to be more present. I was expecting the vocals to be more live sounding (if that makes sense). It’s also too bad that you need Amazon HD to get the best sound out of it. Also, I wish there were more 3D songs. Where I think Amazon dropped the ball the most was the launch. I had to wait a month to get it because it was out of stock. Also, from what I read, it was very buggy and required firmware updates.",5,0.9754,Positive,156
173,"Likes: Sounds good, looks sleek, does 3D/Atmos audio.
Dislikes: Very simplistic and outdated bluetooth support, no support for LDAC or APTX. Anything listened to via bluetooth will sound blah at best. Very poor handling of aux/optical in. The unit can not be switched manually and will freeze up completely if a cable is left in. Incredibly annoying given that bluetooth isn't a good option either.

Summary: If you plan to never use this speaker with a HD Audio source such as a phone, tv, dac etc and only plan to use it for Alexa/Amazon Music and other built in functionality its a good product. If you want to use your phone or other device with a cable and with no loss of fidelity or via a modern decent sounding bluetooth codec look for something else such as Sonos or other brands.",3,0.5875,Positive,141
174,"tl;dr: Excellent Bluetooth and Wifi speaker for home music, audiobooks, and lectures, with minor static noise.

I've wanted a speaker for a few years. I've upgraded my other listening devices (Oppo PM3 planar magnetic headphones, and AirPods Pro), but I've waited to get a speaker for my TV, or MacBook, and my life. I read all the reviews for the Bose, Google, and Apple products, and I ended up getting the Sonos One. Sonos was an excellent brand, but after getting the Sonos One (Gen 2), it just wouldn't set up with my home's wifi. I tuned the wifi, reset the wifi, and changed my wifi password, all to no avail. So I shipped the Sonos One back for a refund, and waited a few weeks until the (conveniently) Echo Studio came out. I had high hopes, although I had gotten an Echo Dot in the past that never paired to wifi either.

Anyways, the Echo Studio paired to my home Wifi with ease, and paired to my MacBook Pro with ease. It also came in a gorgeous container like Mac products. The sound quality is great; I'm still fully assessing it, but it compares well with my PM-3 headphones. I just wanted an audiophile-like speaker that could play music, Audible audiobooks, and lectures from my professors, and this delivers. I've never used Alexa before; I just want basic Alexa functionality to tell it to play some mood music for house guests, and it looks like it can do that. The Echo Studio just has this weird static in the background. It was very noticeable; then I reset the device, and it's still perceptible if I turn the audio way down, but it's very minor. Maybe I'll call tech support on a rainy day. Overall, very satisfied!",5,0.9939,Positive,297
175,"I purchased 2 of these fantastic speakers because I wanted to enjoy the Stereo Home Theater effect they can do. Setup was a bit tricky but calling into the help line took care of it pretty fast.

The sound quality is really something to behold. I was able to go into a Best Buy to listen to it and compare it to other smart speakers. The 3D audio was what impressed me the most, even when compared to the Bose 500, especially when you consider the large price difference between them! I do realize however, that most audio, in music or movies, is not in 3D at this time.

Even so, there have been a few times the sound effect sounded like it moved to the side or suddenly moved behind me. So, awesome.

The voice recognition through the built-in microphones are very good and no matter what part of the room I am in, they seem to hear me clearly almost each and every time.

There was one thing I was disappointed in. I have the speakers connected to my Fire Stick 4K and was hoping the Alexa assistant in the speakers themselves would have been able to do each and every function the remote control was able to do, but it cannot. I was hoping to never need the Fire Stick remote but certain functions such as, TV input changing, are not available.

I added the Samuel Jackson voice to the speakers and totally love it. While not for everyone, I find the humor and more, ""adult"" conversation to be a definite improvement to the voice control. I'm hoping it will be expanded to give it all the same controls the Alexa voice has.

Overall, I am very happy with these smart speakers and plan to add the sub woofer very soon.",4,0.9974,Positive,304
176,"Its a good speaker. But not awesome, the re-calibration is a bluff. The sound its just like a regular 360 speaker. Actually Boss or JBL have better sound quality. The HD 3D streaming from Amazon its just ....... higher qualityvstresm qith less compression. But not 3d as you get with a proper dolby atmos setup. Just pass!",1,0.7141,Positive,57
177,"I use Bluetooth to play audio (music, podcasts, etc) from my laptop, and audio from my TV (Netflix, YouTube, etc). I don't want a bunch of cords connected to speakers to do this - especially not to my laptop. (Moving your laptop when it's connected by a wire to your home audio system is potentially dangerous.) The Echo Studio doesn't work well for the Bluetooth case. The problems:

(1) If you have two Echo Studios and want to use them in stereo, you can play Amazon music or Pandora via the Alexa app. But if you want to play audio via Bluetooth it doesn't work. It will only play out of one Echo Studio. This means streaming music off my laptop or playing Netflix/YouTube with bluetooth audio doesn't work in stereo.

(2) Whenever you use bluetooth audio with a video (Netflix, YouTube, etc), there's a visible audio-lag. People's mouths don't line up with their words. This works fine with my old bluetooth speakers, though, so it's obviously not a problem with bluetooth in general. It's a problem with the Echo Studio speakers.

(3) When I was looking at the the Echo Studio, I saw that it can connect to bluetooth speakers. I was hoping that I could add my existing bluetooth speakers to my home surround-sound system. In other words: 2 Echo Studios + 2 existing bluetooth speakers = 4 working speakers for music all over my home. No luck with that. When you connect an Echo Studio to bluetooth speakers, it doesn't play out of it's own speaker. The end result is that, even though I have 4 speakers, I can only use 1 or 2 speakers at any one time because Echo Studio can't handle that case.

I will say that the Echo Studio does sound very good, and if you only want one Echo Studio (i.e. you don't want stereo coverage) or you only want to play music using their Alexa app (i.e. stream Amazon music, Pandora, Spotify, or some other music-streaming service), then it works perfectly well. Be warned, though, that Amazon music requires that you pay a monthly subscription fee - either for Amazon Music Unlimited or Amazon Prime. The whole thing seems like a pretty narrow use-case, and not really aligned with what many people want from their home audio system. A lot of times, it feels like speaker manufacturers are using their speakers as a way to keep customers inside their little walled gardens that require monthly subscription fees.",2,0.9891,Positive,416
178,"Great value sounds great works as a sound bar as well, hooked right up to fire cube and they work together well!!",5,0.9183,Positive,22
179,"Very disappointing and frustrating. Communication not enabled yet it constantly shows green light for incoming messages. Voice commands work on Roku TV, but sound still only comes through TV speakers because, apparently, that function will only work with Fire TV. App is flaky and often unresponsive. Volume fluctuates with no adjustment, as do equalizer settings. I set them how I want and 30 seconds later the bass and volume jump up or down.. Tech help was no help. I'm considering returning it, as my primary interest was listening to HD music and improving TV sound. Speaker quality doesn't live up to what's advertised. Trying to think of a reason to keep it, but don't see the point. Consider what you plan to use it for before purchasing - doesn't really live up to sound quality claims.",1,0.1493,Positive,136
180,"Just got on Prime Day, so this won’t be a long review, yet. Setup was relatively easy and a big step up from my 1st generation Echos. Sound is excellent (unless your expecting marvels from a small package).

But, what has me posting this so quickly is the shock I experienced when, after setting it up, Alexa asked it I wanted to hear a sample of 3D music. I can’t post any lyrics here without the likelihood of being suspended, but if you Google WAP by Cardi B, you’ll know why. Now, I’m an adult and can tolerate these things. But if you’re a family with young kids, BEWARE! A few clues: Use of the ‘n-word’ is the least offensive part. And the P in WAP stands for that body part the President grabs. If I’m not the only person who got this as a music sample, I’m surprised Amazon hasn’t been sued.

On the good side, this device helps integrate older Echos into the system, where previously standalones can now be combined in an ‘everywhere group playing notifications from all three Echos.

I looked at reviews of the subwoofer, some with paired Studios for a pseudo 2.1 system. My take is skip the Echo Sub and another Studio, and use this for what it’s good at.",3,0.9514,Positive,217
181,"I combined a pair of these with my FireTV in Home Theatre mode. After a week or two the grouping would fall apart and I would have to re-create the grouping in the Alexa app. I blamed my home network/wifi and upgraded it to a Ubiquity Unify mesh system (which rocks). Alas, to no avail, the home theatre grouping eventually failed. This time after 2+ weeks but it continued to fail until my wife asked that I get rid of them and put the old stereo speaker pair back. During this time I upgraded the devices in the hope that it was a firmware/OS issue but it didnt help.",1,-0.8457,Negative,109
182,"This speaker sounds really great, especially in it’s booming, clear bass. It wipes all other echos away in terms of sound quality. Should you also subscribe to Amazon Music HD? I really don’t hear the difference in Amazon HD vs premium Spotify through this speaker. And the 3D music is just marketing - it still just sounds like it’s coming out of the speaker (obviously). There’s no throwing the sound behind you and enveloping you in sound.

I also bought the optical audio cable to connect the Studio to the tv to use it as a soundbar. There’s some weird software bug that you have to restart the Studio so that it will recognize that the input is now the optical port. Amazon should have already fixed this as this is its’ premier Echo device.

So buy it for the great bass and Alexa assistant, not the promise of surround sound. And I’m sticking with Spotify.",4,0.9158,Positive,156
183,"Great sound, especially with hd music. Microphones work better than any echo I've had. A friend with hundreds of dollars worth of sonos was blown a way by the sound of this speaker for the price! I will be getting another to replace a second gen echo in my bedroom.",5,0.908,Positive,50
184,"Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.

However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...

At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.

Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.

No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.

Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.",4,0.9966,Positive,490
185,"The 3rd gen DOTs drove me crazy at the horrific sound and complete lack of bass response. Next was the 4th gen smart speaker with ""crisp vocals and balanced bass for a full sound"" which also was disgustingly AM-Radio sounding.

So I figured I'd try this studio speaker. Okay, it's decent. You can finally hear low bass, and you can reach respectable volume levels without distortion. However it is still very much a directional speaker...and the trebble is projected 180 degrees from the power cord...which is a straight plug. This configuration means you can't really have this studio speaker flush against a wall. Well, unless you don't mind missing trebble projection into the space you are trying to fill with sound.

For almost 200 per speaker, this is really disapointing. I've got 2, one in my master bathroom and one in my living room - both configurations are frustratingly limited due to specific sound propogation. Am I unreasonable to want to place the speaker flush against a wall, and have the sound be projected away from the wall? That would simply require the plug to be either 90 degree flush mount, or moved 45 degrees in either position.",4,-0.8027,Negative,198
186,"From an audiophile: I've been an Alexa user for awhile now and have dots pretty much all over my house. I caught a sale recently and decided to give the ""Studio"" a go. Placed in my master bedroom just one of these fills the room with sound (that whole end of the house!) and it's quality stuff too! The bass, especially, is impressive for such a small woofer (it out thumps my 2.1 desktop system with ease).

Is your money spent better elsewhere? I have a dot in my kitchen plugged into a Bowers & Wilkens A5. This is a $400 speaker from a very reputable audio company. The B&W seems to have ""drier"" mids and highs, which may make me think it's slightly ""more accurate"" sounding, but it doesn't have the deep reach at the bass end of the frequencies as the Studio does. Both are of comparable volume, maxed out, and both are of similar size and weight. And the B&W costs TWICE as much! Let's cover this idea for a minute... Yes, the B&W may present more of an ""audiophile"" sound but if I had to do it again? I'd take two Studios and pair them over the A5, for the same amount of money!

I have a fairly elaborate home theater/music system in the living room that cost about as much as a good used car. Again, an echo dot acts as a source to feed music through custom built dipoles powered by a stack of amps. I love my music (and movies) and enjoy spending time in the living room doing just that. But the Studio in my bedroom keeps me satisfied to the point that my living room time has gone down significantly.

Is the Studio perfect? I think the mids and highs may be rolled off a bit, producing a more ""laid back"" sound. Some EQ in the Alexa app may adjust it more to your liking, if this sound isn't it. For me, it's great just the way it came shipped. The 3D audio is VERY good and while I'm tempted to pair it with a second one, one has proven to satisfy my listening pleasure far more than I expected. The bass is deep, without sounding muddy or ""booming"", although I wonder if it wouldn't tone that down a bit automagically, if paired with an Echo Sub. The Alexa implementation is, as you might expect, excellent. It's fast, responsive, and the mics are plenty sensitive.

I'd love to see what Amazon could do with a 5.1 or even 4.1 implementation of this speaker, for a surround sound setup.",5,0.9977,Positive,437
187,"I hesitated to try this but my high price sound system was just nut cutting it in our family room with vaulted ceilings. I set up two Studios with the Echo Subwoofer and Echo Fire TV and the sound is remarkable. The sound balanced perfectly for the room, the bass is not overpowering and the highs and low frequencies are spot on. I can’t be more satisfied with this experiment. I just wish I had done this sooner.",5,0.9223,Positive,78
188,"Pro: the sound quality is very good.

Hooked it up with both a line-in 3.5mm cable as well as blue tooth and both sounded very good.

Bass is above average if not phenomenal, but overall I’m very satisfied with songs, movies and even Alexa. She sounds more natural and warm with this Echo.

Pro: look and feel are high quality

This speaker is heavier than you would think at first glance, especially for its size. It’s not especially compact but it’s smaller than I expected. I like the white light that displays the current volume level.

Con: horrible setup procedure

After powering it up, the instructions say to open my Alexa app on iOS and follow instructions. Nothing appeared. Had to manually add it.

After manually adding it, It was not clear AT ALL how to use it with my Fire TV Stick 4K. Was I supposed to pair it via BlueTooth? Was I supposed to add “Fire TV” streaming service to it so I can allow Alexa to control the Fire Stick TV *through* the Echo Studio? After literally hours of searching the Internet I learned you had to go into the Devices section, click the + button in the upper right and select “Setup Home Theater”. What?! That’s not even intuitive! Even then I had to deregister my Echo Studio and re-add it because the first time I set it up, like most people, I followed standard prompts and added it to a group. But for some reason doing that didn’t let me select it later as part of a home theater. So my advice: be patient, it’s unlikely you’ll get it right the first time.

Overall: if Amazon included clear instructions, or even a link to helpful tips. That would be one thing. But even if you Google “set up echo studio with Fire TV” you will get a dozen Amazon links, none of them pointing you how to “setup a home theater” under the Devices section.

Finally: you’ll want to get the Fire TV remote with volume control. That allows very easy manipulation of the Studio’s volume which is SO much better than constantly asking Alexa to change the volume during a show.",4,0.9744,Positive,367
189,"I've had the first and 2nd gen Echo, which I use to control my media center with the Logitech Harmony Hub. The Echos has always done their job, but the sound was always lacking when playing music. Hooked the Echo Studio up this weekend and the sound is, so much better than before. Fills our Kitchen / Living Room areas with great sound and we will definitely be putting it to use during the holidays. If you can find space for this speaker, which is a little larger than competitors, I'd definitely recommend it.",5,0.9812,Positive,94
190,My first echo studio worked flawlessly and sounded amazing first day then two days later I decided to play some music and only the woofer worked and all other speakers were dead. Customer service was very helpful but all troubleshooting led to them sending me another device. The new device showed up in different packaging which is a concern since a 3 day old device should be replaced with a new.... but out of the box the speaker was popping and crackling like an old record when the speaker was active using voice or audio. So customer service tried again and the third device I opened had the same plain black box with no power cord and same popping and crackling. I’m so disappointed in this speaker!!!!! Sending it back for a 3rd time this time I thinks it’s time to find a different speaker.....,1,0.4456,Positive,145
191,"I will start with the cons. Home Theatre, I can't tell Alexa to turn off, I only can un pair in the app. When listening to the tv/home theatre, the sound drops completely if my wife is talking to Alexa in another room, perhaps hearing her through the wall. Yet while using home theatre she often doesn't hear me as if I'm drowned out by the audio she's producing, when she does hear me all TV audio is dropped while listening. If I pause the video the sound isn't in sink for 30 to 50 seconds on resuming, it gradually catches up. Announcing the studio is bluetooth paired when I turn my computer on too early in the morning to be making noise. Much of this can be fixed with Amazon programming so get to work people.

Pros- Seems like a great centerpiece for the smart home. One studio unit but home theatre sounds good but not 5.1 good. Fantastic sound, the bass is so solid and clear without being excessive, makes me want to stereo a pair while tossing my old fashioned high quality components. Love having it play music from my home computer. The bonus 2 light bulbs work perfectly with the built in zigbee unit and with some struggles I eliminated a sengled unit for the bulbs I was using already.",4,0.9777,Positive,224
192,"I come from the audio industry and I own an upscale analog audio system and I'm blown away by the Echo Studio. I personally believe that digital music currently does not match digital music. But I'm a believer that digital music, done right, can equal analog music at a fraction of the price. Amazon, with some help from Dolby and Sony, has now established that this can be achieved in a closed, controlled, environment.
Amazon has put together a ""front to back"" music system that is beyond belief. Their Echo Studio is the perfect companion to their just introduced HD/ULTRA add-on subscription to Amazon Music.
I can't believe the sound quality of the Echo Studio for the price. I guess Amazon is removing all the hardware cost barriers so they can sell subscriptions to their HD/ULTRA Music service, which is where the real income is generated.
My only criticism is that the Echo Studio can have a tad bit better audio quality. Great Bass and good Treble, but the mid-range can be muddy. This can be fixed with the great Alexa app that is dedicated to the Echo Studio. But the real hardware fix for this comes at a cost expense, so I'm sure that in a year or two we will see an ""audiophile"" Echo Studio II at a premium price.",5,0.9908,Positive,222
193,"Our house has a large open family room/kitchen. We have an Echo1 in the living room and wanted to get another speaker to place on top of the refrigerator to listen to music while working in the kitchen. It seems that a lot of small speakers are designed to be taken outside - built in batteries, etc. The sacrifice for portability is sound quality, so we were not interested in those. We looked at Bose, Sonos and this Studio. The Bose with built-in Alexa seemed overpriced compared to the Studio. The Sonos speakers seemed nice, but many of the reviews mentioned proprietary software and systems. I often like to listen to music while getting ready for work and didn't want to have to deal with intermittent bluetooth connection issues while rushing around. We have an Amazon Unlimited Music subscription and I have always loved being able to just ask Alexa to play any song I wish, so we opted for the Studio.

The Studio was amazingly easy to set up since we opted to ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup"" when placing the order. Honestly, we just took it out of box and placed in on top of the refrigerator and plugged it in. We didn't have to specify a wireless network, provide the password, etc. - it just connected and worked right away.
It took about 5 minutes to figure out how to create the ""multi-room music"" group. Once we did that and played our first song request simultaneously on the Echo1 and the Studio, the sound was absolutely amazing. Being able to adjust the Bass, Midrange and Treble on the Studio is an added bonus.

Although we were really impressed with the sound quality, we opted for the Amazon Music HD upgrade. They advertise a 90 day free subscription with the purchase of the Studio, but we were not given this option. I called support and they explained that this offer was only for ""new"" subscribers. Since we already had Unlimited, we were not eligible (not nice). Still, we were given a one month free subscription so - why not.

The sound of the multi-room system with HD is beyond amazing - as close to concert sound as any speaker I have ever heard. It completely fills the entire first floor of our house with high quality, deep bass, clear treble sound. Our annual music cost is going to be $129 a year now (unlimited was $79 - the HD is an additional $50) but given the quality of the sound, it is well worth it.",5,0.9979,Positive,430
194,"* Audio quality - solid, tight bass, right size. Love the ""initial"" audio tuning based on placement of the room. I am unable to find that option after moving to a new location. I would have to set it up as new again. I would have given a 5 star if the BT audio streaming could be on the par as online streaming.

* Bluetooth audio streaming issue - I am sure Amazon must have done this on purpose when the algorithm is tuned for Alexa and online streaming. The BT streaming is still as bad as ever and very low volume. I am not the only one that complain. The audio quality is so bad and one has to change the volume to max to get to an average level. This would cause a major problem when you ask Alexa something or changing to online streaming. It does not cause that much to add a dedicated high quality BT chip. If you are using an integrated BT wit the Wi-Fi ASIC for onboarding, then just switch to a dedicated BT chip to take advantage of all the efforts done with this speaker. This is definitely a trade-off Amazon Echo team and management decided. Too bad... think of it as having a V8 hemi but you limited to only a V4 pinto when comes to BT streaming.

195,This device was poorly programmed. You only have to say alexa play music from....on the other devices. On this one you have to say Alexa play music from.....on echo studio. EVERY time you have to state echo studio. By the time you get all that out she often stops listening. We called Amazon just to figure out that on our own. If you don't say it every time she tells you its offline or not enabled or unavailable. Too much of a pain for me so back in the box it will go. Amazon promised a call back in 30 minutes to resolve this but they never called back. Love the other Alexa products I own but this one is horrible. Don't waste your money on this one.,1,-0.6546,Negative,128
196,"Dont listen to the negative people. this is amazing!! The sound will blow you away. The bass response..WOW!!

I was playing the 1812 Overture, and at the end of the piece of music, the Cannons Blow! It made my dog jump off the bed and run!

All music, that comes out of this speaker is improved dramatically!.

I bought this, to have in my private lady cave. I can kick back on my couch, a scented candle, shut the door...and listen to any music I want, soft or loud.

The one thing I wasnt expecting. The weight or the size!! A pleasant surprise! these are NOT Cheaply made. This Studio Speaker will take any echo speaker you have, and make you want to throw them away!! I'm Not exaggerating either. Wow!

if you are looking for Audiophile quality, then dont look here..which makes me think, if you are an AUTHENTIC audiophile... you wouldnt be looking on Amazon, would you? I thought so!

Set up took mere minutes!
It has great ears, to hear all your commands!
Wherever you place it, the built in AI, will optimize the sound for you!
Yes The AUDIO Trifecta!

200,"I used this as an alternative to a soundbar to the TV on my patio, plus as a smart speaker replacement for music, so it's doing double duty. The sound quality is not on par with ""dumb"" standard wired speakers like my NHT 2.1 that requires separate amplification. Still, the sound is the best of the smart speakers, definitely better than the original Echo Dot, the original Echo and the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, all of which I currently own. One negative: The Alexa app doesn't walk you through syncing with your TV even if it's already connected to a Fire TV Cube, as mine is. I did a chat with support and got connected to the cube, but it still didn't sync with a fairly new Sony TV. So I grabbed a second device to search for how to do that and eventually that worked. The Echo Plus has pretty darn good sound for a device that has a much smaller footprint and heft but the Studio's size gives it better bass and maybe a tad more richness. They're in separate spots and I haven't done a long comparison so that's just a general feel. Overall, I like it and more colors and more instructions will only make it better.",4,0.9857,Positive,211
201,"Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up.
1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet.
2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy.
3. Looks great
4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus.
5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost.
6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs
7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.

I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear.

I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.
First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.
1. Noticably louder
2. Highs more present and crisper
3. Vocals not as muffled

I temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.

The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.

As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.

Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.",4,0.9965,Positive,592
202,"I have echo devices in 5 rooms in my house for convenience and to listen to my amazon HD music subscription when cleaning, cooking or working around the house. I have two echo show 8's and a dot that with the small speaker size sound decent but are unable to produce any bass. They do not sound as good as my regular echo. I was looking for something that would have better sound and be able to produce a little more bass. Based on reviews I was also thinking that once I move my current 7.2 home theatre to the basement I could pair two echo studios together instead of using a soundbar on my living room tv.

Due to the larger size the echo studio is able to produce more bass than the shows or regular echo. I am still trying to adjust the mid and treble hoping to get the echo studio to sound better. But for the price I was not impressed. It produces more bass than a regular echo, but overall sound does not seem as good. Depending on how I adjust the mids and treble it tends to either sound muddled or shrill. The volume is decent, but you are unable to turn the volme all the way up without speakers distorting. Not sure if this is the speakers or if there is an amp built in producing thd. It also tends to create sweet spots in the room. You can walk around the room and find areas where the music sounds a little better than other areas. I purchased the higher level amazon music subscription for the 3D music but was not impressed with how it sounded on the echo studio. Maybe it is how I have it located in the room. There were not instructions with it, so havent figured out how to get it to re-analyze the acoustics of the room after you move the device to a new location without having to do a factory reset.

Overall its not bad, but was not impressed with the sound or how it fills the room. I dont think I will purchase the second one to pair with this one and use in place of a soundbar for my tv. If I had it do over, I think I might try the sonos instead. I will keep trying to tinker with the sound adjustments and room location to see if I can get it to sound better. I will update my review if it works.",3,0.9437,Positive,421
203,"I bought 2 of these to set up a theater system. Set up individually, they work AMAZING. The sound is great and as a stand alone smart speaker, it is the best of the ones I own (Echo 1G, Dot 1G and 2G, Show 1G and Show 5).

The problem I have is that the connection between the speaker and my 1G Cube breaks constantly and I have to do a reset ever 2-3 days. TechAssist say that it is because it is switching back and forth between my 2.4 and 5.0 networks even though I have the networks set up separately. Never once during set up did I ever see them connected to my 2.4 network. Tech filed a ticket, but I don't know how much that will do.

After multiple resets and set ups, eventually they do set up and work. Usually it takes about 20 minutes and 3-4 cycles for it to work. But I have to ask myself if it is worth spending the time to set the whole thing up over and over. Sometimes I only have time to watch a movie... and after doing the set up I don't have time to watch it anymore.... which is annoying since that is the very reason I bought them.

If the situation improves I will update the post. If not, I will be returning both speakers. You have until mid-May, Amazon. Please fix this.

It has been 3 weeks since my original post and things have gotten worse. Now my media player which I purchased from the Amazon App store which has worked flawlessly is now out of sync with the Studio speakers... when they work. They seem to work fine watching YouTube or short shows on Netflix or Hulu. But as soon as I settle in to watch an action movie where you really want that big sound.... NOTHING.

I'm tired of waiting for it to get fixed and I'm tired of each tech just having me run through the same thing that the previous ones already had. My issue apparently got escalated... but I can't tell since the tech that was supposedly going to call me back NEVER did. Normally I don't put blame for my dissatisfaction on Amazon, but this time it is your product. Loved it when it worked.... but doesn't work enough.

206,"This opinion is based off of a $200 price point.

Pretty good sound but weak base and muddy mids for its size. I like the fact that I can use it for the home studio setup by pairing with another studio and a sub. With the micro optical connection to my TV it's ALMOST an awesome option for surround sound. I say almost because although you can control the sound when connected through your 4k Fire Stick, I have no way of controlling my volume when playing the regular TV or a PlayStation or something other than Fire. I shouldn't say no way. I can go back to using multiple remotes and control the volume using my fire stick remote. But who wants two remotes? Amazon needs to call up Harmony and work out some integration. Then you'd really have a solid product.

I would hold off on buying this. The sound isn't that much better than a $70 echo unless you're doing 3D sound and even that was kind of meh.

207,"I bought this Echo Studio from Best Buy last month because they happened to have a really good sale (loss-leader, maybe?) that included a free Amazon Echo Show 5 and Phillips Hue lightbulb. At the time it was a better deal than what AMZN had to offer. I got it to enhance the sound in my study where I already have a Logitech Z625 speaker system connected to my high-end laptop. I thought it would provide better sound for when I was on a treadmill or rower vs my Logitech Z625 system. It does provide good sound -- better overall than the Z625 -- if you don't mind losing out on bass. The highs and mid-ranges are much better than the Logitech, but it really is lacking in bass. I wish there was a way to combine the two systems (OK, there probably is...I'll try to figure out a cable of some sort or splitter so they both get inputs from the laptop) so that I could have a good balance of bass and mid- to high-frequency sounds. If you're looking for ""crisp"" sounds and great Alexa integration but don't mind poor bass response, then the Echo Studio is for you. It's great for a party atmosphere and high volume, just not good if you want to truly experience a well-balanced, high volume, sound.",4,0.9919,Positive,224

It’s where we spend the most time right?

The first studio I ordered was a refurb and just would not connect. No big deal, Amazon was great as always with returns.

Next one connected but has just never been acceptably responsive. The sound quality is great. This thing is built like a tank and is BIG. But we have interaction issues with this like we’ve had with NONE of the others. Wont recognize voices, just shuts down mid command, or one of the other alexa devices a room away picks up our voice and takes over.

209,"I am supremely disappointed with the device I received. I was skeptical about it as soon as it arrived and I saw how it was packaged. It was in it's box from the maufacturer and then, in true Amazon fashion, it was packed in a box 3x the size required with 1 sheet of kraft paper as 'padding'. So, it basically bounced around until it arrived. I guess I should be happy it works at all?

It does not arrive with the needed optical cable to connect it to the television. I had to buy an adapter to make the one I have fit.

I notice about once every 4 or 5 days sound will stop coming out of it completely. Not while I'm using it, but in the morning, first thing. I have to pull power from it for 10 seconds and repower. It will work again for 4 or 5 days and this must be repeated. This is for audio from the TV, I have not tried to play music through it before pulling power. I will try to remember that first thing in the morning when all I really want is coffee and the weather report....

Another thing I just noticed today. While playing music it will randomly drop to volume '0'. Every 10 or 15 minutes. With the music 'Everywhere' option I notice none of my other Echo devices (Echos or dots) will do that. They keep playing.... because that is what they've been asked to do.... Not the Studio. Just decides, mid-song, that it is done. I have to turn it back up.

For the price, it sounds good. This is not top quality, but I was not expecting that. It is good for the price.

Then there still the problem with 20% of command being ludicrously wrong. But would the programers code these things to at least stop giving you wrong response? Of course not.

You need to unplug the echo power and plug it back in to continue using the port. I'm hopeful this will be fixed soon but will need to return it before it's too late.

I purchased 2 of these and now they are basically echo device.
If you’re seriously considering getting this because you think it will be a 360 surroundsound experience or something of that nature you will be heavily disappointed.
My problem is I bought these didn’t use them right away and once I started I only had a week to play with them. And now it’s too late to return them. I would rate the current value of each one of these devices at no more than $50 and the price is only that high because you can use them as a hub. Huge disappointment again. This was their second attempt at some cool surround sound with a Alexa hub I don’t know if anybody remembers the echo bass speaker, but that actually sounds better.

Amazon makes a lot of good products, This one though they got completely wrong again. Please Amazon if you decide to make another version of this have some of your quality control guys listen to the device before they sell it on the market.

As a music system it’s great. You can control the sound with a 3 band equalizer on the Alexa app. The bass is great. The Alexa voice control is adequate.

I can reopen Spotify and resume playing where the device stopped, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a hands free device. To be clear, I also have a google nest and it works perfectly with Spotify. After contacting amazon Customer service and getting the run around, I’ve learned that “they’re aware of this issue and working very hard to fix it”. A quick google search indicates that this has been an issue since 2018, so their crack squad of IT folks are perhaps on a 2 year vacation.

I was able to connect this to my Fire TV 4k Stick and it took over for my TV speakers admirably (though this did take me messing with the LG HDMI settings to make it go). The sound watching shows is far superior to the LG speakers, as you'd expect. I ride a bike with a fan on during my show watching usually, so having this put out good sound above that is great.

We watched a couple of old movies with it on and I saw a couple of Witcher episodes. Sound works far better than any other Alexa device. I have a Play 5 soundbar from Sonos and it's not as good as that, but you would not expect it to be given the $400 price difference. It is solid sound, but not overwhelming sound.

Given that I now listen to more music (e.g., Sirius XM integration through Alexa), I wanted a better table top speaker with Alexa. This one, the Stuido, is much larger and more robust. If your reason for upgrading is better audio then this is it. I looked at some of the competitors which are starting to have Alexa integration (like Sonus etc), but on cost/value/integration, this one seemed to be the best. I can tell you it has quite good bass sound and it can fill the room. I've read where some folks don't think the higher end is good enough - well, on balance, I think its because the bass response is so good; plus the mid/high end has a series of internal speakers that simulate a surround sound type of experience. To my knowledge the Studio speakers do NOT sync with another Studio to produce a true one-room directional stereo sound field. I didn't really want that (if I did I'd get the Sonus). My unit sits on the kitchen breakfast bar, a bit away from one wall, and it sounds great. I've not tried it on the floor or a bookshelf - just remember that the speaker self-adjusts to different locations so it will sound a bit different as you move it around - I recall there are instructions on this aspect.

I looked back at my original Echo purchase -- the Studio costs about the same as what I paid for the Gen 1 Echo. I think Amazon just took the Echo name down-market and replaced it with this.

223,"Good day Amazon!

So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.

I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range. FWIW.",3,0.991,Positive,661
224,"I have experience with a lot of Alexa devices. I have an echo dot second generation connected to a Samsung soundbar in my living room. My son has an echo dot connected to a dock with a battery and speaker in his bedroom. I have an Ensignia Fire TV in my bedroom, a fire TV stick in my livingroom, and even a fire 10HD tablet. My parents have had an Echo since it first came out.
I purchased the Echo Studio to replace the Echo Plus second generation which I had been using for only a few months in my bedroom. I liked the Echo plus overall, but the soundstage which it created simply was too narrow for my tastes. I wanted to get a device which would make music sound better in my room, and I really wanted something to connect to my TV to improve its sound.
In terms of sound quality, I would go so far as to say that the Studio is impressive. Out of the box, I feel the sound is a little flat, but just a bit of tweaking of the bass and treble settings fixes this. As other reviewers have noted: The bass doesn't quite reach subwoofer frequencies, but it gets close, and it is more than adequate for my application. In contrast to some of the reviews I have read, I find vocals to be clear, and highs are crisp and can even be piercing when properly configured. The soundstage is quite wide, even on regular stereo tracks, and even whnen using music services other than Amazon. Amazon HD music makes the whole thing sound better, and 3D music sounds even better yet. I'm hopeful that more 3D music will become available in the future.
I was disappointed not to be able to configure the Studio with my Fire TV as a home theater setup. Apparently, the TV which I purchased just this past July doesn't contain a late enough version of the Fire TV, and updating firmware doesn't help. I really, really don't want to have to purchase a Fire TV stick for my fire TV; that just seems weird.
Nevertheless, I did connect my bedroom TV to the Studio with a mini optical to optical cable. The sound is fantastic, but there is a catch. If I power off my TV for a half hour or more, then come back and turn it on, I don't get any audio unless I disconnect, then reconnect the audio cable. This is not a deal breaker, but it is annoying, particularly if I have to get out of bed to do it.
Overall, I'm happy with the Echo Studio, but it would be really nice if the optical audio worked better, and it would be nice to have a wireless connectivity option (other than low-quality Bluetooth audio) for my fire TV. I understand that I shouldn't necessarily expect atmos support from my current TV, but something between Bluetooth stereo and wireless atmos would be nice.",4,0.9897,Positive,502
225,"I have a lot of Alexa speakers throughout my home and business. I love the ecosystem and really dig Amazon's echo product line in general. For the price on the regular echo, especially when it's on sale, it's an insane value for what you get in terms of size and sound. I thought the Studio would have similar value. It does not.

I have a Sonos one that I use as my main Alexa speaker in my living room. I have a newly built smart home and my house came with the regular echo, an echo dot, an echo show (2nd gen), and the Sonos One. The Sonos sounds the best out of all of them so I put it in the room where I listen to music the most. Recently I decided to move the Sonos to my business and replace it with the Studio, thinking that the studio would be a better speaker, since people are raving about it on the internet. I mean, it is a bigger speaker and a newer design. And, since the regular echo is such a good value, I figure it's likely that $200 spent on a Studio would equal a better sound experience than $200 spent on the Sonos One. I was wrong.

I got the Studio today and it looks impressive right out of the box. I plugged it in and tested out a few tracks, and it sounded pretty good. I couldn't yet tell if I liked it better than the Sonos. I mean, it was obviously louder and had more bass, but it was hard to judge since I hadn't listened to the Sonos all day.

I put on a hip hop station and started listening casually. A couple of songs in, it became obvious to me that the bass, although louder, was kind of clumsy and didn't seem to hit perfectly with the other sounds. I thought meh, maybe it's just this song. Then it happened with another song. So I moved it to another area of the room, and listened to it at different distances. I went into the Alexa app and messed with the EQ and toggled the sound enhancing feature that everyone on here talks about.

The feature makes a difference but honestly makes the music sound kind of tinny when it's off and muffled when it's on. So that was another layer of suspiciousness. Then, when a particular song came on, called ""wasted"" by JUICEWRLD (don't you judge me now), I noticed that during one of the parts that he sings in a higher pitched tone, there was a VERY noticeable crackling. Wtf?? I know I didn't just hear that. Then the chorus came again, and it did it again.

I combed through forums, factory reset, and tried everything I could to make it sound the way I wanted. Then I was like you know what, I'm just gonna plug in the Sonos and see how it compares. WOW. As soon as the Sonos played the same song not only was the crackling non-existent, but everything else sounded way better, too. Even the bass. The Studio has louder bass, but the Sonos is so clean and precise with the way it hits and maintains sustained low notes. I'm not a self identifying audiophile (nerds) but that's the best way I can describe it. The Sonos is definitively better all across the board at the exact same price. Plus, it's less than HALF the size.

I wanted to love the Studio and was sure that I would. But I'm returning it. I won't even keep it to put in another room because it straight up sounds like crap to me. I'd honestly rather have another regular echo. Amazon missed on this one. I don't know how it got so many good reviews. Get the Sonos instead. People say that it has problems with the microphone but I've never experienced any of that. Only problem with it is that it doesn't pair with other echo devices for ""everywhere"" playing, so be aware of that and decide based on your needs.",2,0.9946,Positive,684
226,"One month update: I've had the chance to listen to a pair of sonos one sl and I can confidently say there is no comparison. The sonos are head and shoulders better where it counts: sound quality. The studio is good and at least $100 cheaper, but you get what you pay for. My studio will get moved to a smaller space in the house. The sonos are taking center stage.

Yes, it sounds light years better than any other Amazon device I've heard. Calling it studio quality is a stretch. My biggest problem to date is that this echo device is worse than any other I've had at listening to my commands. My oldest and cheapest echo dot is far better at hearing and understanding me over ambient noise. It's a great sounding speaker, but is it worth $200? I'm still on the fence. I'd like to compare it to another before I make my full decision.",3,0.9643,Positive,158
227,I love this speaker it is very easy to play to music but does have some issues. The microphones seems to not detect your voice as well compared to an echo and usually I have to say Alexa a second time for it to recognise the command and that's with it not even playing music . My echo 3rd gen always picked up my Alexa wake word everytime compared to the studio . I don't like how if you put the studio in a group with a firestick to play movies it won't show up as a echo studio by itself in the Spotify app and I have to stream to the group that it is in and it'll pull up the song my firestick as well and I cant do anything on the firestick while I'm playing music to my studio . I wish i would be able to be able to stream to just my studio when I'm on Spotify and not have it show the music on my firestick when it's in a group for home theatre . Other than that the sound quality it great and the price is reasonable.,4,0.9673,Positive,194
228,"I am not really a super audio techy kind of guy, I just wanted an Echo with improved sonics over previous models. And this delivers! As an owner of a 1st gen Echo, 2nd Gen Echo, Echo for Car and Echo Dot, the audio quality has been my only disappointment with the Echo series. I thought the Echo Sub was overpriced, so the release of the Echo Studio was just what I was waiting for.

Now, does this sound as good as an expensive bookshelf stereo system? No. But it is much improved with nice bass response and decent enough highs. The 3D music aspect is really lost on me, but I've heard it is quite impressive. It is surprisingly large, and the blue ring is difficult to see unless you are standing over it, but that is not a deal killer. I will say the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as the 2nd gen, so placement is key. Overall though, the Studio is a keeper and I'm really happy with it so far.",4,0.9773,Positive,177
229,"I linked the Studio to my Fire TV Cube via the Alexa app on my phone, and the process was straightforward. The sound quality is excellent! I love the Alexa integration as well as the hub functionality.

I am taking 1 star off because of the limitations to connect my DVD player - the only options seem to be via Bluetooth (not sure whether my DVD player supports this) or optical-in, and from what I can tell, connecting this optical-in cable mutes the Bluetooth connection to the Fire TV (meaning, I can't leave the cable connected). I'm still working on this, because my DVD only has Digital Audio Out, so I would have to use a switch box with Digital In to Optical out. The Studio needs HDMI-in.

Update: lip sync was a problem, unable to adjust in the app. Finally fixed by switching the Fire TV from hardwired (Ethernet) internet access to WiFi access. Makes sense because the Echo Studio is WiFi only.",4,0.4728,Positive,164
230,"I ordered a pair of these speakers and a Fire 4K TV stick for my upstairs TV. And everything you've heard about the sound quality of these speakers is true. Once all three items were paired in the Alexa app the sound was terrific!

The problem is that it is only available using the Fire 4K TV stick. I knew that going in, but I didn't realize how limited the Fire 4K TV stick was. It doesn't work well with some of my preferred apps, for example in fast forwarding content it just gets stuck. At the time of this writing some apps like HBO Max simply aren't available.

Why am I docking the speakers for limitations of the Fire stick? Because Amazon should have greater support for them outside of its own products. I have several other streamers available to me like the Nvidia Shield that work well with my preferred streaming apps, but there's no way to get the Studio's great sound with them. Sure, you can pair with the streamers via Bluetooth, but only one speaker. The sound is muted and tinny, not any better than my TV's own speakers.

It's been a year since the Studio has been out, if Amazon was going to support it with other streamers it would have by now, or at least make the Fire stick work better with apps. This is critical and I may wind up returning the Studios. Right now the only way to get decent sound with all my streaming devices is to use the Studios with the Fire stick and my soundbar with everything else. It's not a good choice.",3,0.8736,Positive,274
231,"I bought my wife an Echo Studio for Christmas. I was going to hook the Studio up with my Apple Airport Express in the kitchen. The Echo Studio and the Airpot Express has a mini Toslink port so I thought I will hook the two up with a mini Toslink to mini Toslink cable for the best sound. Sounds easy but this particular cable was very difficult to find. No one carries one, including Amazon. Finally got one from ShowMeCables.com. A 3 foot cable cost about $10 (includes shipping). Alas, when I tried to plug the cable in to the Echo Studio, I found the mini Toslink port recessed with very little room around the hole. The cable plug was a tiny bit too big to fit into the recessed hole and in trying to plug it in all the way, the darn thing broke! I ended up connecting the two devices with a standard 3.5 mm cable. So much for all the effort and expense. If anyone from Amazon is reading this, please pass it on that you need to allow more room around the port as most mini Toslink plugs have a fatter than normal plug.

234,"Comparing the Echo Studio to this Bose Home Speaker 500, the results reflect the small cost difference. I'm really displeased with the direction Amazon has taken with music, and this is more fuel for the fire. I don't want to have to worry about if my music is 3D and optimized for the Echo Studio device. I also don't want to pay a monthly fee for music, as I already own what I'm interested in, but you know- Amazon no longer lets me upload my music. Yeah- real helpful Amazon- thanks a pant load. Back to the speakers. The Echo device does better as an Alexa host- it's faster to respond and works well. The Bose is slower and the phone app is beyond primitive. However the Bose can go louder. The Echo Studio is reportedly 300 Watts. Bose won't say what the Wattage is, but maybe that's where the ""500"" came from? I kind of doubt that, as the Bose is not so much louder than the Echo. For audio quality, it's the Bose by a not dramatic, but noticeable margin. I also don't know if the mute switch on the Bose is mechanical (like the Echo) or just software, so if you're paranoid, the Echo may be a better fit. The business where Amazon claims the Echo Studio is able to detect the room and adjust the audio accordingly? Yeah- I've not heard anything that'd suggest that's so. I have it in a living room and it's not really ""wow'ing"" me. maybe if you're in a dorm room it's different. Summary- if you were going to get an Echo, get this one. If you want better sound, try Bose, Sonos, or some other Alexa enabled option. Your mileage may very, batteries not included, void where prohibited, etc., etc.",2,0.9831,Positive,300

Not bad but . . . not great either. So far the bass response of this unit is lack-luster and far from meeting my expectations. It's big, it's heavy, and just like my first GF, it didn't put out the kick-ass sound I was looking for. From a buying perspective, I would wait for this product to mature a bit before pulling the trigger. Who knows, possibly a FW update could clear-up the mids & highs, while keeping the presence real and loud?

I have two echo studios in my living room and two echos in bedrooms on the first floor of my house. If I ask Alexa to turn off the lights, THREE echos respond.
I chatted with their ""help"" staff and they told me that if I chose to turn sidewalk off, I'd have to change the wake word of echo devices to prevent this from happening. GREAT!!! Now I get to try to remember four different wake words? This is ridiculous.

240,"Purchased my first studio from a major chain as Amazon couldn't ship until after Christmas. Purchased my second studio from Amazon about a month later. My setup includes the two studios, 2 original echos, a gen2 echo dot, a 5 inch echo show, two thermostats (honeywell and lux), five cameras (blink and wyse), two lights (feit), and a few plugs (kasa and amazon).

Plus -
Easy setup just like my Echos and Dots. Runs all my devices.
Better bass.
It has some weight to it.
Has an optical cable port.
Can pair two for stereo.
Dolby atmos if paired with some firesticks.
Plays UHD and 3D music via Amazon Music HD subscription

Minus -
Bluetooth pairing – hard to pair with my Bose QC35ii headphones. I could barely hear the sound setting the echo studio to volume 9. Worked better after a firmware update.
Light ring – location is wrong, can't see it from across the room, so never know when you have a notification, never mind if it is processing.
Stereo pair – once you pair two of them together you lose the bluetooth functionality with music. The headphones will connect but only voice will be transmitted, the studio will break the connection to play the music through the stereo pair instead of the headphones. Very frustrating if you are trying to use headphones on a treadmill. Customer service says this is the intended functionality.
Optical port – none of my toslink cables fit this port, it seems to be a combination optical port and a analog port, requires a completely different cable.
Connection issues – sometimes it will lose connection with amazon music requiring a reboot.

Overall – I like the bass, I like the HD music, and the sound isn't bad. It has more bass than my other smart speakers. The microphones work well. Functionality works the same as other echo devices, so I can control all my smart devices via Alexa. I didn't like losing bluetooth connectivity if you use two studios as a stereo pair. I understand the issue but by breaking bluetooth it doesn't give me a lot of incentive to keep paying for Amazon HD music. I had some other issues with the music where it would acknowledge my music choice and then come back and tell me it had trouble playing my music. This can be fixed with a reboot of the studio. I haven't been able to use the optical port as it seems to use a non standard cord. Haven't tried the Atmos via the Fire stick. For the cost it is a better speaker than most but don't expect it to replace your high end surround sound system.

Tips – I now plug the studio into an amazon smart plug, so I can tell another echo to turn off studio and turn on studio, it is easier than having to unplug the studio if you need a reboot. This reboot seems to be required after a firmware update. I gave up on trying to use bluetooth with a stereo pair. I was told I could break the stereo pair to use the headphones but the only way I could do that was to fire up the app each time I wanted to use my headphones. My solution is to use another device for headphones, luckily I have an echo show in the same area, so I use that for the headphones as I run on the treadmill.

248,"So I've been a pretty big fan of Amazon stuff for sometime. I use Amazon Basics stuff whenever I can. I also rarely leave reviews.

But this thing was a big enough disappointment and continues to be a frustration that I figured people need to know some stuff.

First off, as an Alexa device, it's fine. Plays music, does the 4 other things Alexa is able to do (different rant).

But one of the main reasons I got this thing wasn't for Alexa or as just a music player, I wanted to make a 2-studio-1-subwoofer home theater.

Well it really sucks at that so far. Connecting using the Alexa app is fairly simple, but it just refuses to be a reliable home theater system. It constantly drops sound, or has intermittent sound loss. Happens randomly. Sometimes I'll just turn on the TV and only the sub will be working. So I'll have to recreate the entire home theater system. It's also really picky about what it will and won't work with.

Also it refuses to connect via wired Ethernet like its fire TV brethren. And if the fire TV you want to make the home theater with isn't on the same SSID (as in, if my fire TV is connected via wired Ethernet and the studio\sub aren't) then it also makes problems.

As for sound quality, it's good not great. It doesn't quite fill a large, open floor plan family room. If you're looking for a better sound quality home theater than a comparably priced sound bar\sub combo will probably beat whatever studio\sub combo (dollar to dollar). I know going from my 6 year old LG soundbar\sub to the studios\sub did not improve overall sound quality to any noticeable amount. But I also got it for home automation reasons so I was ok with that.

I think if you want this for just a much better version of the echo plus that plays music then you'll be happy, but hold off for at least another 6-12 months if you're looking for a home theater upgrade.",2,-0.5454,Negative,345
249,"You can't find anything that will compare at this price point. I bought one and added a second to make a pair a week later. Yes it will work as a stand alone speaker but it is so much better as a pair.

As a powered speaker it is amazing. What happens with powered speakers typically is that if you crank the volume up the built in amplifier clips at loud passages. That means the amp cannot supply enough power to drive the speakers resulting in really bad distortion. I cannot get Studio to get clip. That means they have been engineered with plenty of reserve power. They are rated at 330 watts each but I believe that's very coservative and they handle peak power demand much higher.

As stand alone speakers they handle mids and highs very well. Playback of streaming 3D content from Amazon was very good. My 13 yr old son who is not an audiophile(yet), remarked while listening to Shawn Mendes Unplugged in Ultra HD. ""It is like being in the front row""

Are they audiophile grade? No. Why? There is no bass. Frequency response is only down to 50hz. You can hear bass but you cannot feel it. What do I mean? If you have been to a live venue, the drummer steps on the kick drum pedal and a thump hits you in the chest. That's what I am talking about. You need a powered subwoofer to take the setup to the next level. There is the Echo Sub but I cannot recommend it as it has only a 6"" driver. The limits of physics. Bass is all about moving large amounts of air. A 6"" driver only moves 1/4 the amount of air as a 12"" driver. Unfortunately the Studio does not play well with non Echo equipment.

Wanting to see how far I could take the Studios, I took a chance and figured out a work around. I bought an Echo Link and hooked it up to a 12"" 1000 watt powered subwoofer. With much difficulty I now have it working with the Studios using a multi-room setup hack. Right now 2 x Studios, Link and a large powered subwoofer is easily producing a listening experience similar to that of using equipment costing thousands of dollars. And you have the added bonus of voice control. If you have the Fire Stick, you can stream Dolby Atmos content to the speakers. Good Dolby Atmos Home theater sound for under $1000.

I think Amazon has done an excellent job here. No other audio equipment manufacturer can touch the Studio in terms of value and being able to add to. Sonos, Apple and Google are miles behind.",5,0.9646,Positive,452
250,"EVERY DAY I HATE ALEXA JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

I was going to raise my review because I am getting it to work, a lot more effort that I think it should require, but you know what. Zero stars. BELOW ZERO. Friends come over and laugh at how poorly it works. Can't do a single thing without acting like a sick and dying animal. MALFUNCTIONS AT LEAST 10X PER DAY. Connected to bluetooth, disconnected from bluetooth, never stays connected never continues to do anything for any steady period of time. You want to relax? Nope. You want to listen to music for over one hour, don't think so. You want the device you are standing 1 foot away from to reply? No chance. Has it ever finished ONE single book? Stuck on volume 2. Will not continue, restarts a 9 hour book. Amazon music plays the exact same songs every day. Then, it has the nerve to ask if you want to subscribe to relax, subscribe to listen to a book, subscribe to Amazons terrible selection of music at a ""higher quality"". Sure we can't complete one single task for one solid day. Can't even get the lights to work every day. Just flip the switch up and down, literally making turning a light on more of a task than it was in the first place. Please check your network connection. Never shuts up about going to the Alexa app to solve your problems.

Muted the microphone on all the dots because the app would not let me change the wake word. So that helped a LOT to keep the wrong devices from replying, 90% of the time from across the house, behind walls, and closed doors. Plays music in the entire house from internet services so that is great. Am happy that the bluetooth connects to my PC automatically, other than nothing else will connect if the pc and bluetooth is on. Only plays from one speaker but at least it sounds good.

I wanted to come here and raise the rating, I want to like it, because you have to know how and when it is going to screw up, but, I also wanted to listen to music with out getting angry for 5 minutes. Took less time to just connect it to a stereo, which never one single time in its life disconnects and connects to something else on its own. No matter what, laying in bed, walking out the door, that is when it is guaranteed to screw up every day. Can't stay linked, can't stay connected, can't connect to what you want, can't find an answer, can't ever work. Go to the Alexa app. Go to the Alexa app. Go to the Alexa app. So much for hands free convenience.

251,"When we ask Alexa to play a piece of music from our own download library, we have to sit through a lengthy commercial for Amazon music service. Once should be enough!!!! Not subject us over and over to the same thing. I don't know how to turn it off. Also it does not seem as sensitive to picking up my commands as our other older device. I have to shout Alexa instead of just saying her name as before. But.... the constant commercials for Amazon services are unforgivable .",3,0.5526,Positive,89
252,"This is my first impression of the new Amazon Alexa studio

I received two Amazon Alexa studios at 3 o’clock on November 7, 2019. I watched a lot of the reviews on YouTube and liked what I saw so I bought two of them so I can pair them in stereo. Upon getting them call Dan and set up I noticed that the sound was really good. The high fidelity and stereo separation is very noticeable and a great upgrade from the previous three Alexis that I had scattered around my open concept living room/ kitchen /dining room. On the good side they are very well-made and surprisingly heavy. On the downside I wish they were a lot louder, when they are on as loud as they can be I can easily speak over them without yelling. For $435 I thought they would be bangin’

A few features that you should now are that once you pair them in stereo mode they cannot be paired in a group with the other five Amazon echoes that I have in my house. It’s either the Eco Studios or my everywhere group. The big square transformer that is plugged into the wall and all of the other Amazon echo devices is built into the unit on the studio device. You have a typical plug that plugs into the wall. So if that big square plug was an issue on your echo device before that will be gone with the echo studio.
In the first few hours of using the studio in the stereo configuration we Noticed that after about five minutes the music would just stop! I tried everything to figure out what was going on but there was no answers. I asked Alexa what happened and she replied I don’t know that one I went into the app to try to see what was going on and even when I pressed play again in the app it didn’t play and when I press pause it didn’t do anything either. Hopefully this will be taken care of in a software update.
I know it’s the first day for the unit release, so I’m going to give it a few more days and update my review.",3,0.9722,Positive,372
253,"Let's review the good and the bad.

In general, we listen to our music at volume 5 or lower (Alexa volume 5).
1. the Studio's sound enhancement is absolutely awful. We turned that off.
2. the Studio's flat EQ makes it sound almost identical to the standard Echo. Testing side-by-side and at volume 4 and under, nobody could tell the difference. at volume 6 you start to hear the difference and higher volumes you start to get the low end of the woofer. But we never listen to our music that loud. so not worth it.
3. the Studio's microphone missed so many things that the Echo never misses. You have to talk louder and closer for it to work.
4. the Studio's music playback doesn't work consistently. Alexa will be silent for 10 seconds and then say there is an issue. However, with the Echo we have never had that response (in years).
5. certain Alexa requests don't work. Alexa repeat - ""there is nothing to repeat"" after pausing...Alexa play ""there is nothing to play"". Again, we never get this response from the echo. It always keeps track of the song that was playing.
6. The Studio needs to be out in the open for it to sound decent. We tried putting it on a shelf but it sounded muffled.
7. The Studio is big for what it puts out. There are better, punchier speakers that are smaller (and less expensive)
8. The Studio doesn't replace the need for a sub. Which is why I bought it. I thought it would have a full sound that would negate the need for a sub. It doesn't, especially at lower volumes.

For the price, you can get a sub speaker combo that will be richer in sound. And at lower volumes, the Echo has nearly identical sound. No one in our household or that visited was impressed.",2,0.849,Positive,316
254,"I’m having fun. Still trying to understand everything that it can and can’t do. I get frustrated at times and other times thoroughly impressed with this invention. Sometimes it’s just weird. At times it’ll just turn on by itself. CREEPY! Just saying! Otherwise I like it. Being of an older, technically challenged type of person I must admit that that there’s a lot for me to learn about how to make the most of my experience with this device. Why is studio the best for instance? Speakers?",4,0.8919,Positive,87
255,"I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.

Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.
Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.

First Impressions:
The studio looks and feels to be well built
It seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).
The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.

Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:

Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.

Bottom Line:
The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.",5,0.9979,Positive,555
256,"We bought one Echo Studio to put into our bathroom to replace an older Echo smart speaker. The difference in sound quality and features in the Echo Studio was breathtaking. From the simple setup (just plug it in and open your Alexa app), to easy linking to your phone, or use of Amazon Music, Pandora, and smart home control, this speaker has it all. I'm an audiophile who still listens to vinyl, so I'm picky about how my music sounds, even when I'm in the shower. This speaker DELIVERS on quality sound and easy access to your favorite tunes with just your voice. No need for a separate subwoofer here, the bass in the Echo Studio delivers full, rich sound. The right and left speakers create a full sound stage that puts you into your music. The auto adjustment of the sound quality (done for you at setup, no buttons to push or knobs to turn, or microphones to mess with) for your room size makes a huge difference in the quality of all music, not just 3D audio. If you're looking for a great sounding smart speaker with a built in hub for your home, this should be your first choice. I have used competitor's products in the past (Siri, Google, etc.) but they all pale in comparison to Amazon Alexa when it comes to smart home integration. I can control my lights, my TV, my garage door, my thermostat, my music, and even my washer and dryer all from my Echo Studio smart speaker! And every day, more and more products are integrated into the Amazon Alexa eco-system, far outpacing competitors. You simply can't go wrong with this amazing product. We loved it so much the first day we had our Echo Studio, we ordered another one 24 hours later for our Kitchen! I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a smart speaker that doubles as your go-to music streaming speaker, and even for use in an apartment style or small home, home theater setup.",5,0.9931,Positive,341
257,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these speakers. I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:
- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.
- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding
- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore
- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me
- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantly

Cons:
- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.
- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!
- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.

Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.

So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.

If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.",4,0.9981,Positive,557
258,"I was really happy with the 1st gen Echo I bought on pre-launch, then I got a couple of 1st gen dots (sound was really disappointing but I didn't buy them to listen music on them so I was fine) I got a 3rd gen dot and loved the enhanced sound experience.
Now, after lots of youtube positive and mixed reviews, I decided to buy the Studio as my main driver right next to my PC.
As a stand alone echo, this is by far the best, sound is rich and surrounds you. It's loud and clear enough to be heard from pretty much any room in the house, even when its physically located in my home office.
Now for the not-so-amazing. I bought an optical to 35mm optical cable to connect this echo to my PC as PC speakers (one may think this is possible, right?) well.... while this works the sound quality is not as impressive as when it's playing from the Alexa systems, also the volume is way too low; if I decide to increase the volume on the echo to get descent volume from my computer any echo notification will blow your ears out so not a good solution.

That said, I think my use cases (I try to use the devices I buy to the full extend of their capabilities) are niche and not representative of most users.

Is there a better sounding smart speaker out there? probably, many people say Apple's sound better but SIRI sux so that would make it an overpriced dumb-smart speaker. Sonos better? well yes but sonos only plays music.

My personal opinion is, if you are an Alexa user, buy this speaker, you won't be disappointed. If you are google assistant user, well do your own research :P If you are an apple Siri user, time to change!",5,0.9959,Positive,309
259,"Ordering the Studio Echo along with a Smart Plug has been the most negative experience I have had as an Amazon customer. Usually, Amazon's is first rate, even impressive, in its efficiency and customer service. This order, however, seemed to have slipped through the cracks.
To begin with, I ordered the Studio Echo in late November and was surprised to receive an email two days later estimating the order to be delivered in six weeks, which would be early January. My payment card was not debited, which seems to be a standard practice when ordering through the internet. I expected the charge to be processed once the item was shipped. In mid December--out of the blue and without notification--I received a heads up from my card company that an ""unauthorized"" charge had been made on my account. At this point I did not make a connection between my 3 week past Amazon order and the charge that suddenly appeared on my account--I had not received a ""heads up"" from Amazon of the charge being processed or notification of the order being shipped (which it had not). As a result, I immediately contacted the card company and disputed the charge thinking my account had been compromised. My card was cancelled and a new one issued. It wasn't until the charge was tracked to Amazon that I made the connection with my order of the Studio Echo. I had to back pedal my charge dispute, but the card had been needlessly cancelled. It turns out that even though it had not been shipped, Amazon was running a ""charge check"" to make sure that my payment was sound. Really? I have been a steady Amazon customer for YEARS and have never had a hiccup of any kind, and now they have to verify I'm good for a charge less than $200? This was just the beginning.

True to the information I received, the Echo Studio arrived in early January. The Studio itself was in its original box inside of a brown shipping box. The Smart Plug was in the same box. There was no packing material around either box and the Echo Studio box had a crunched corner and the taped seal was broken--apparently from ""rough"" handling?

Now for the Echo Studio review itself-- Setup was relatively easy, involving the downloading of the Alexa app on my iPhone. I had purchased it, hoping to use it to supplement the audio from our Smart TV. Reviews have stated that it can be linked two ways to television, through bluetooth or through pairing with a FireStick. It has been noted that people have found that with bluetooth there is an audio lag. I found that to be true of trying to access the video through our FireStick as well. It worked, but it was like watching an old sci-fi movie from the sixties. Audio was completely out of sync. I also found that as a speaker itself, the music seemed to be of poor quality, even after adjusting the bass and treble levels. It sounded ""boxy."" So I initiated a return.
I received return authorization from Amazon and was given the choice of printing up a return label myself and sending it back or taking it to a UPS Store where they would box it and send it back. The email also informed me that my refund would be processed 2 to 4 hours after Amazon received it.I dropped it at UPS on January 4th and received confirmation that it arrived at Amazon's return facility on January 6. Two days later, I contacted Amazon about the refund and was told that I should give it a business week and to contact them if I did not receive it by Monday, January 11. I called Amazon customer service and spoke with an agent who then told me that it was their policy to wait two weeks before issuing a refund for electronic items--despite the fact that their email to me said it would be a matter of 2 to 4 hours. It wasn't until I spoke with a supervisor that she authorized my refund. What a fiasco!

This has not been an experience that I expected with Amazon, but it has made me wary and hesitant before making a similar purchase from them in the future.",2,0.9876,Positive,720
260,"The best speaker on the market. I have bought, tried, and returned the Sonos one and Bose speakers. I was skeptical about this speaker at first, but it really surprised me! Great sound range with ample bass. 360 degree sound and even plays 3D music. I’m buying another one to round out the stereo effect! I also bought the subwoofer, but I have not received it yet.

The other two brands do not seamlessly integrate with the Alexa system as claimed/insinuated. You have to first use the clunky apps provided by each company to get the speakers set up and then pull them into the Alexa app. The big dissatisfaction here is that none of them would play in a group with other echo speakers. You can play all of the echo speakers or the Bose/Sonos speakers, but not all at the same time.

I first listened to a selection of Ultra HD music & was ""blown away"" by the clarity of the music tracks--it ""filled"" my Living Room! And what a Bass--it really impressed me! Then, I played some of the 3D Playlists & could not believe how I felt as if I was listening to the music LIVE! It really filled the room & surrounded me!

262,"WOW a very nice super Echo. More and more of everything you have come to expect in an Echo. This is our 4th Echo and by far the best one. Cons - big foot print maybe 3 times the diameter of a regular Echo. Now the Pros - everything in an echo plus internet control of alexa devices. And the big new is the Sound is overall many notches above the regular echo. We tried a small echo dot - these are ok if you want to do some basic alexa things, plus it has a small speaker that is a small speaker. The regular echo that we have 3 of is really a nice background speaker with access to the amazon play lists, and you can purchase more music options as you might want. The next echo up the tree is the basic full size echo with the ability to control alexa devices - turn the lights on and similar. I was an original X10 system user and this setup is just better than X10 but this is not home automation.

Echo Studio I purchased after reading a few reviews - my concern would it really kick up the sound a notch or more, not all of the extras included in the device. WOW it really is an amazing device for sound. It takes a little bit of time to find itself in a room and optimize to that space. Take your time and let the device work its magic. Then listen. Deeper bass, great mid range and highs I gave this studio to my wife for her use plus gave her one of the echos for her listening area on the screened in porch. Her only complaint is when am I going to ask for the Studio back. Super easy setup once you understand you have to install the alexa app on your smart phone.

I am not shopping for another echo studio - maybe for stereo but really for another room in our home. Great job Amazon.",5,0.9958,Positive,340
263,"So you did the echo dot, and you decided alexa was part of your life now. So now you want some better speakers? You played with those Dot docks that sounded horrible. You were tired of having to turn on a separate set of speakers or dealing with bluetooth dropouts. You wanted a simple solution that sounds great? Is this it? Is it the echo studio? No... unfortunately not.

1) Alexa integration is great! as you would expect from a first party amazon product. This does work just as good as that dot you're replacing.

2) It is a tight and clean package! Yes it is. Very easy to setup, and very slick looking on the shelf.

3) The bass is so much better! Well yes it is. The bass is better than that echo plus, and certainly better than the echo dot. That said don't expect much. I've had a bose wave radio in the past and know what bass can be managed in tiny package. This is not as efficient. It is not bad though.

4) The overall sound quality is Audiophile! No it is not. It's not bad. Think sound quality of a mid quality bluetooth speaker. I do have a JBL charge and the JBl charge does sound better (although it is boomier, it has a more pleasing and ""full"" sound). I replaced a Echo dot sourcing in a Bowers and Wilkins Zeppelin Mini. The Zeppelin mini is about the same footprint, but sounds so much better! But running a Zeppelin mini means i have another remote, and have to turn on the Zeppelin when listening to music and hook up the 3.5 cable. This is a ""clean"" solution (see point 2).

So should you get it? Honestly it is a great thing. The speaker will sound great to 95% of the people (as you can see by the reviews). To my ears they sound pretty ok! Inoffensive, honestly that's the best praise. 3 stars for music quality, 5 stars for design. Averaging 4 stars.

What needs to happen to get to 5 stars? Amazon needs to make it easier to make a good alexa product (because the 3rd party ones are not good thus far), or Amazon needs to poach a couple of audiophile speaker designers and have them go at it. I know this was certified by the dolby guys, but dolby knows how to make theatre systems, not musical speakers. Maybe some help from the NHT or Bower & Wilkins guys can help.",4,0.9981,Positive,420
264,"I have several generations of Echo Devices. I bought this to replace a second-generation Echo and am thoroughly impressed with it.
The sound quality is very good. I have this in my living room, which is designed to make a sound engineer go crazy. The room is 25x20, with hardwood floors, a full wall of windows, paneled walls, and overstuffed sofas. But the room-shaping feature eliminates the echoing effect those hard surfaces tend to create with higher frequencies and the bottoms don't get absorbed into the soft ones.
Bass response isn't quite what you would get from a dedicated subwoofer, but this is the first Echo device that can deliver a decent bottom to music. The intricate bass parts in music from groups like Rush and Yes don't come through as a muddled mess. As for volume, this thing is quite loud. My downstairs is something of a spoke room layout, and with the Echo Dots in the kitchen, office, and master bedroom I am able to get true house filling sound. By the way, did I mention this speaker is loud? At 5, it can be clearly heard at the far end of the house. At 8 and above, the voice recognition begins to suffer - you need to shout at it to be heard. That is the only drawback I've found so far. However, I don't often play it at that volume, so it isn't annoying.
Finally, the room shaping feature also means that having it paired to my Firestick gives me a lifelike sound, but I understand that having two Studios in conjunction with the Firestick can deliver true surround sound. I suppose I'll have to purchase another to try it.",5,0.9639,Positive,284
265,"Update 1/6/2020
I called Amazon Tech support and explained I could not play multi room music with my echo studio. I think the developer updated the software for this problem or by tech support removing my saved WiFi passwords solved the problem. I am giving another star to 4 for the fix.

The studio sound slightly better than my 1st gen echo and echo sub combination. I might dabble with playing movies from my 4K Firestick to see how it sounds.

The hardware is second to none. There are some software issue amazon needs to correct in the future. This unit will only pair with a Echo Sub and another Echo Studio. I was trying to pair my 1st gen echo my echo studio and echo sub. It would not pair. I called tech support and the first guy did not really have a clue. The second guy was telling me that the software on the 1st gen echo is different from the software on the echo studio. He advised me this issue might be resolved in the future.

When I just paired the echo studio and the echo sub together I was not impressed. My echo sub and 1st gen echo setup sounded way better. I put the echo studio in my guess bedroom and it actually sounds better without an echo sub. Because of the software kinks I can only give it a 3. Eventually amazon fixes these issues. The echo studio is still fairly new. Many time when echo products first launch they have software issues.

I have confidence that amazon will fix the kinks. If this issues bother you I would wait until they are resolved to purchase one.",4,0.9652,Positive,283

Not only is it cheaper to buy 2 and sync them for a stereo pair, but the Dolby atmos sound eliminates the need for satellite surround speakers. I have 2 in a stereo pair connected with my amazon firestick 4k for the home theater set-up. sound is....ok. I previously had an echo plus in my living room that I used for music. I moved it to the kitchen. when I listen to whole-home music, I can hear the bass from echo plus in the kitchen over the 2 studios in the living room. the bass is NOT what they claim it is even with the bass turned all the way up in the equalizer. will be purchasing the echo sub if it ever comes back in stock. They also are VERY glitchy. if I go from listening to music, to watching tv on the firestick, I lose sound altogether. Its like it gets confused when switching listening modes. I have to continuously switch the volume control from the fire stick between TV and home theater system until finally I get sound back. they also get really screwed up if you ever lose power. they wont respond at all without resetting them. then you better make sure they are both working when you think you have them set up again. I lost power one day, and every time I tried to talk to one of the echo's, the light ring would light up in response, but no sound came out. Then I tried playing music and put my ear to it and realized there was no sound at all coming from it. for no reason at all. everything was set up correctly and online. I had to reset it, delete the stereo pair and home theater, then re-connect it as a stereo pair and home theater so it would start working again.

267,"It's very interesting how when you set the Stereo Spacial Enhancement button in the Alexa audio settings for the Echo Studio , it sounds like the audio images for the various instruments are spread throughout the room. Apparently it uses micro delays on the five speakers (three mid-range, one tweeter and one woofer, along with two bass ports) to accomplish this effect. There are tiny holes in the top of the unit from which it constantly samples the sound and adjusts the audio image according to the room acoustics. If the unit is placed properly, that is, according to the instructions provided, (like not putting it too close to a wall) the effect is very impressive. Some people may not like it. They have the option of toggling the Stereo Spacial Enhancement button off. Admittedly, I had to get used to the sound. I'd turn it off and on again for comparison for about a week. I've decided that I definitely prefer it. If you set your volume to at least 6 (volume goes from 1 to 10), you can really appreciate it. It's certainly different, but I love it. I did not like it when used for sound on my TV. It sounded like you were in a movie theater. Very dramatic, but I have only one Echo studio, and it's extremely annoying for the sound to be coming from the side of the TV. You'd need a unit on each side of the TV to have the effect work properly. You can't put such a large unit in front of a TV to center it. If you used a pair of them it would absolutely blow you away. Apart from all that, it's use as an Alexa smart device is just what you'd expect. I have a few Echo devices in my home for smart home use. The Echo Studio is nothing short of excellent in that regard. I'm looking forward to further developments, as they are on going.",5,0.9484,Positive,331
268,"I purchased a 55” FireTV edition TV to replace an older TV and a FireTV cube in my bedroom. The downside to getting rid of the cube was we had to turn the TV on and use the remote to control our lights abs smart home. The sound of the TV was ok so I purchased two Studios, one for each side of the bed to improve the sound experience and resolve the need to turn on the TV to do smart room commands. It was a little overkill but what the heck.

I received both studios, fired them up and followed the instructions only to find out they don’t pair in theater mode to my new TV.

After some playing around and calling Amazon they told me just to add a cheap Firestick it pair them with. I already have a FireTV, I bought it to free up space and get rid of the cube. Well the cube is back.

With the cube everything paired correctly. The sound is ok, not as amazing and immersive as some would say.

I have these a lower rating for the following reasons.

Don’t pair to devices outside of the fire tv stick and cube family together. Yes you can use Tv’s Bluetooth but only for one and not two.

They haven’t figured out that syncing multiple Alexa devices in the same room would be helpful, especially now that I have three voice activated devices. They get confused easily so I have to mute the two studios.

So essentially I paid over $350 to buy two wireless speakers. A sound bar and a 29 dot would have been sharper and I still may return the studios.",3,0.7644,Positive,283
269,"I was so excited to learn about the Echo Studio and of course, treated myself to one for Christmas. The sound is indeed 'bigger' than the regular Echo device and it's nice to be able to adjust the bass, mid-range and treble using the Alexa app on my phone. The pre-set bass tends to garble the rest of the music and reducing the bass, upping the mid-range and treble helps but it still sounds like it's 'missing' a lot of nuances in the vocals and instrumentals. Which brings me to my next long standing gripe with the Echo line....

There is no where to plug in head phones so that one can listen quietly! When I opened the Echo Studio I was excited to see that there was an input jack and I thought I'd be able to plug my headphones in there, but alas, no sound came out of my headphones. I was hoping that perhaps the music would have greater clarity with the headphones. In my neighborhood, the homes are very close together and I'd really like to able to listen with headphones, especially late at night without disturbing the neighbors. When the Echo first came out, this is one of the suggestions I made right away - headphone jack, please!!

Anyway, I do like the Echo Studio overall. One other thing: While Amazon evidently has some selection of ""3-D"" music, it would be nice to be able to browse those specialty selections or to see where the 3-D music overlaps with my own music preferences. Thanks for always innovating, Amazon! Keep up the great work!",4,0.992,Positive,268
270,"After much anticipation I received my Echo Studio today!! I immediately opened the box and was like a kid at Christmas!! I immediately set it up and moved on to part two, pairing it to my Fire Cube, or so I thought. What seemed, and for all intents and purposes should have been, a simple process required a phone call to tech support. The technician was very helpful and after 10 to 15 minutes had me up and running YYYYAAAAAAYYYYY!!!! And then my elation turned to utter disappointment. The only means of adjusting the volume is by the traditional, Alexa Volume Up, Alexa Volume down. There is no way to control the volume by your TV remote or even a Fire Cube/Stick remote. Who wants to yell out ""Alexa"" while watching a program. How inconvenient, how disappointing, such a shame. This product could be 10 Stars out of 5, but now is just another 3.5 star very good speaker. And it is that, honestly, it is an excellent speaker for everything other than a sound source as a home theater.
UPDATE>>>>>>>>>>>>While I agree that the Studio is an excellent speaker, it is useless either alone or with a paired Studio as a surround system for your Firestick or Fire Cube. There is not enough bass, at all, and it appears that Amazon has discontinued the production of the Echo Sub Woofer, which would have made this a DYNAMIC paring and very easy to use.
I have two, and bought them for this exact reason after watching multiple videos on the setup, the sound and the reviews, only to find that Amazon will not producing the Sub any longer. Now I have two Echo's on steroids that are just for music, and the usual Alexa stuff. BOOOOOOORING. I have spent hours researching for a compatible sub and there isn't one and I can't get Amazon to give me any idea if and or when they may ever produce another, or allow an off brand the permission to develop one.
Oh, and the volume control was fixed by upgrading the remote. That works perfectly. Not enough for another star, but definitely worth letting everyone know",3,0.99,Positive,363
271,"Pros: The voice recognition works very well - even from across a large room. The design is able to blend in with almost any decor. While the largest of the Echo devices, it still fit on our mantle with room to spare. The power supply is built in - there is no external brick to deal with - just plug it into the outlet. The pre-configuration option at purchase makes the setup from out of the box to playing music less than 5 minutes.

The Cons: While significantly better than all other Echo devices, the sound is not “blow me away” “amazing”. If you have only listened to your music using iBuds or bad headphones, you may be amazed. This doesn’t replace the multi-speaker surround-sound capable receiver/amplifier setup tuned to the listening space. Placement definitely impacts the sound quality. The tonal adjustment via the Alexa app is disappointing - just three points and on/off for the spatial enhancement. There should be at least 5 points a a variable spatial enhancement setting. The light ring is only visible from the top of the device - if it is above your line of sight, you can’t see if Alexa is responding/waiting/notifying/off-line.

All that being said, what you get for the price is an amazing value and a huge convenience - which includes some trade offs. It does sound very good if placed properly in the room (yes, it “reads” the room acoustics, but the adjustments it makes are limited). The device is well built, looks good, and works well. Hopefully Amazon makes it better with updates to firmware and the Alexa app.",4,0.9754,Positive,270
272,"So I was very excited to get the new Echo Studio as a Father's Day gift this year. I've been watching them and reading about them since they were first introduced and thought it would be a great addition to my Alexa Family. Well, I guess I was wrong and I'm pretty disappointed, particularly with the sound quality.

I love my music and frequently switch between Amazon Music, Pandora and Spotify. My primary speaker until the studio was a 3rd gen echo which really sounded great. I created a group with the smaller echo spots in my various locations within my open floor plan. It really sounded good, especially the 3rd gen echo which had a surprising low punch and crisp midrange.

So along comes the studio with its room filling 3 D sound and well, it just sounds like crap. My 3rd gen echo sounds so much better. What gives? I've done the room calibration and tried different locations but it just sounds flat and one dimensional. The bass is muddy and the midrange is washed out. Snare drums sound like me tapping my fingers on a table. I'm underwhelmed.

Setup was aggravating too. There is no way to recalibrate the sound other than doing a hard reset and starting all over again. Setting up a speaker group was frustratingly difficult. I had to delete all my groups and start over rather than adding the studio to an existing group.

Setting up the free included Philips Hue bulb was way more complicated than it should have been too. I just can't wait to tackle the dimmer switches I bought too.

On the plus side, its a very sturdy door stop.

I should have just asked for the Sonos....",2,0.6974,Positive,289
273,"I bought these thinking I'd use them in my living room as do all speakers that connect to my TV, and listen to music. When I found out they could be paired together, I actually bought two thinking the 3D sound would be awesome in stereo.

First things first, these things are big and heavy. My wife wasn't a fan of how large they looked on our entertainment stand, but I wanted to give them a chance. They're 10 pounds, they've got to have great sound, right?

Conceptually this is cool, the speaker will adjust itself to the room it is in for the best quality of sound, PERFECT! That said, I'm not an audiophile and I didn't notice any difference in sound when I moved it around, which might be the point.

The speaker itself sounds pretty good, if you really want to turn your music up and feel it though, this probably isn't the one for you. The bass was okay, the sound was good, but I was expecting a serious sound system to rival the sound bar I already had. It fell short in that respect.

Now for the main reason I returned them, these aren't cheap, so my expectation was that they would work with my FireTV stick. They did, sometimes, and sometimes, they wouldn't connect at all, or the remote couldn't control the volume. Having to reconnect them multiple times in the first week was a pain, having the volume not work and having to tell alexa to turn up or down sucked. I didn't want to give up though so I bought a optical audio to 3.5mm cord to see if that would work better... oops, you need an optical out to optical 3.5mm cable; wait a few more days and plug it in. Awesome, it's working with the cable, but the volume can only be controlled by talking to Alexa, not ideal when watching TV. Oh, and if you use the cable, they don't connect as a pair, you can only listen through one speaker. Enough was enough, I wasn't going to keep something that was this expensive and didn't do what I needed it to, I had to return them.

That said, if you're using this to replace a standalone alexa speaker and you want something with better sound. I think this is a great unit, you can pair it with others(which you can do with any amazon devices) and have some really good (not great) sound.",3,0.9953,Positive,415
274,"Definitely sounds better than my Echoes & Echo Shows 2nd gen. and 5. Yes, some people will want more volume and bass but it's fine for our condo.It gets plenty loud and has enough bass for me. The equalizer settings in the Alexa app can adjust the sound some. I switched from Amazon Unlimited to Unlimited HDand it seems to really boost the clarity with some separation noticeable. Can see why many consumers have wanted to pair it with another one for true stereo & immersive sound. Lastly, I have it next to a tv because of limited space and it does have trouble hearing commands sometimes if the tv is on. Otherwise it responds well to commands and sounds great, especially with high definition/3D music.",4,0.9722,Positive,126
275,"Bottom line: if you want a high quality speaker with Alexa built in this is a great choice.

This is my first smart home device and I'm am very pleased with it. The sound quality is superb. I am particularly impressed by the rich resonate bass it puts out given its size. I think the sound quality is worth the money alone so the 3D features are a nice bonus.

Note if the 3D functionality is a major selling point for you there are currently limited songs remastered in 3D (although 3d is catching on and growing), especially if your music service of choice is not Amazon. However, I do think the speaker reacts with video streaming services to mimic surround sound or even 3d if available. I also think the speaker does a bit of the 3d effect for non-3d music.

For me this device has been a great addition to my bedroom. It fills the room with high quality sound, it's plenty loud (I rarely ever turn it up past 4 out of 10), and it gives me the full functionality of alexa. Its particularly nice while I'm working from home to simply ask alexa to play a playlist or podcast and not have to open any apps or turn on any speakers, just instant high quality sound.

This speaker would do very well in a living room as well (or really anywhere you want high quality sound with Alexa functionality). This speaker provides the volume capacity and quality to serve as the sound system for your entertainment center. Keep in mind its best to have it in a central location for this purpose or if you've got the money, there's a special functionality to link to a second one for improved stereo and 3d effects. I imagine two of the bad boys linked up would far surpass the audio of any soundbar!",5,0.994,Positive,315
276,"I purchased the Echo Studio to kill multiple birds with one stone: to replace a Gen 1 Echo, serve as a soundbar for my bedroom TV, as a smart home hub, and to serve as the master bedroom speaker group with my Fire Stick 4k. I chose this over an Alexa enabled soundbar because it was offered at a discount with a bundled Echo Show 5 and Hue smart bulb.

Pros-It does provide very good sound quality. I would rate it a 4.5. The only drawback in that department is that, at least in my application, the dolby atmos affect is hard to notice. It could be my room or the content I watch, so it's not quite a con in my book. Otherwise, it does all of the things you'd expect an Echo device to do in the ways you'd expect it to do them.

Cons-Normally it would only work as a soundbar when you're watching content from specific devices (like my Fire Stick 4k), but there's a mini-optical line in port that allows you to connect it to a television with an optical out with the proper cable. In my case, it would stop playing this port's signal at least once a day. Suddenly, for the past week it stopped this behavior and I thought an update may have fixed the problem. But alas, it happened again last night. Unplugging and replugging the unit is the only way I've been able to correct the problem. The other major issue is that it is out of sync with my Fire Stick, and not even the lip sync tool can adequately correct the problem. It seems like this should be a relatively easy fix with today's technology.

So as an Echo device only, I would rate the Studio a solid 4.5 overall. But as a replacement for a soundbar (which is clearly an intended purpose of this device, which can even be paired with another Studio and Echo sub in a 2.1 system), I'd rate it somewhere around a 3.5. If they were to fix what I assume are two software issues, I would wholeheartedly recommend it as a soundbar as well!",4,-0.2722,Negative,362
277,"5 stars for Amazon on service, but there is a software update needed to deal with audio delay. I use this as a secondary speaker to an Amazon Link. The link connects to my home theatre system. The link presumably is slower than this speaker as the signal comes from a dot goes to the link, than to home set. So there is a horrendous audio delay, as if your on a big event and you hear the echo. There should be a slider somewhere in the software to delay one of the speaker until it all sounds fine, but it doesn’t work. Amazon support said they could not fix the problem on their own set up after testing my problem and said to wait for an update of the software. Until that day comes this just doesn’t work for me.

Google by the way has super easy audio sync options. Guess we have to be a little patient.",2,0.57,Positive,159
278,"We have had the 1st gen Echo, the kids version of the Echo Dot and now the Echo Studio. This review is about 4 weeks in.

The Pros-
The hardware is excellent.
The sound is excellent
3d and HD sounds is excellent
the Subwoofer does a great job
The audible channels present make so many different sounds crystal clear to pick out among the many sounds.
Our car has a really good stereo + speaker set up that takes listening to music to a whole new level, this addition to our home means we don't have to go drive around tthe block to really enjoy high quality audio.
(I know there are tons of options for people to get much better sound, but typically at a much higher price point and much longer set up time and technical know how. This . . .you plug it up and go.
For a piece of all in one gear with smart features this is excellent

The Cons -
There is no remote with the awesome magnetic holder (Why aren;t these included anymore? why are they hard to buy from Amazon?)
The volume equalization between songs is poor, one song at volume 3 is loud and pumping another has to be at 7. (For a smart device and paid service -Amazon music Unlimited, this is a shame.)
The volume equalization between the playing audio and the voice feedback is poor. A song is pumping at 3 and the Echo/Alexa voice is inaudible.

For the price it is an excellent buy. With Amazon music unlimited there is access to lots of HD and ""3d"" songs. This is great, but the volume issue make it annoying to have to bump up and down volume for every song. it might be nice to separate the basic vlume and hte voice feedback volume so the voice could be a static value all the time.
Hopefully Amazon can figure out the volume issues with updates to their services.",5,0.9913,Positive,330
279,"I was buying this Echo Studio for two purposes: 1. For the sound 2. To become my first smart home hub. On the first, it has a promising result. I like the clear sound and decent bass that come up out of it. I have a good size room and it filled the room easily. On the smart hub, Echo Studio is not that great. I connected about 15 switches and lights around the house. I had issues with some of them losing connectivity despite that the Zigbee mesh should cover the entire house. At times, the routines just wont work and I had to restart the Echo to make it work again. The same with the lights and switches that at times work and then just stop working until I restart the Echo Studio. It was annoying since we are not talking about 100 Zigbee devices and just a few of those.",3,0.7721,Positive,153

I knew it wouldn’t be as good as my home theatre system. I knew it wouldn’t be good as the car audio systems I installed years and years ago. But what disappointed me is that it wasn’t much better than the gen 2 echo.

It is better. But not by enough to justify the price. Maybe I’m being too hard on it. I played with the settings for quite some time. Never got it where I wanted it.

3D audio I can’t speak on, too much. I tried it, and didn't notice much of a difference. Seemed like a gimmick.

I bought on Prime Day and got a deal on it. If you’re going to buy it, I suggest you do the same. It’s just okay. Nothing too special.",3,0.8925,Positive,149
281,"I bought 2 echo studios and the subwoofer for the home theater feel. It took me ALOT OF TIME on the phone with customer service not only with Amazon but also with my internet provider to get it to work properly. If you are having constant disconnections from your home theater set up than I hope my review came saves you the 5 hours it took me on the phone.

First, the sound is GREAT! Not as loud as ide like. I wish I could get loud enough to feel like you’re in a club but quality of sound is competitive with that of BOSE. The Subwoofer is a MUST. Makes a great difference!

Changing Internet Settings:
1. To get these to stay connected with each other through the home studio set up you may have to make changes to your internet settings.
2. I have AT&T internet and they happen to have me on what’s called a “Mesh Network”. A mesh network combines your 2.4G radio frequencies and your 5.0G frequencies with each other on one network name. If you have this too, than some of your speakers make pick up the 2.4G signal when another one may be on the 5.0G which will disconnect them from each other everyday and even cause a lot of lag.
3. To fix a mesh network, call your internet provider and have them separate your networks. One being 5.0G and the other being 2.4G. Now when you search your networks, you won’t just see one; you will see two to choose from.
4. I chose my speakers to all be on the 5.0G network as the 2.4G was too slow for them and they lagged. Your fire stick also must be connected to the same network as the speakers and 5.0 will allow for faster streaming as well.
5. AT&T also said that having the passwords different from the two networks can cause lag. I don’t know why this was the case but we ended up having to make my passwords the same for both networks. Also, AT&T did not charge me for any of this as this was all done over the phone.
6. The following is a message from Amazon customer support with some other settings I had changed or checked on:
A. We require that the customer have TCP ports 55442, 55443 open to traffic on their Local Area Network (LAN). They do not need to be opened to the general internet.
B. We also require UDP port 55444 to be open on the Local Area Network. This also does not need to be exposed to the general internet.
C. We also require that devices in a cluster be on the same subnet and that they can communicate with each other. On some routers, this requires the devices to be on the same WiFi network (2.4Ghz vs. 5Ghz) since the two wifi networks are firewalled from each other.",4,0.9813,Positive,489
282,"I ordered this in September. When I set it up, I was VERY surprised at the amount of sound emanating from this device. About a week later, I decided to see if all the speakers that were actually there were actually working. I put my ear close to each, and all were working except the top speaker. That wasn't a good look. I contacted Amazon and that's a whole NOTHER story. Hopefully, the SECOND representative that I spoke with placed everything in order and I will receive a replacement once more are in from the manufacturer.

Suggestion to Amazon. If a product's price is sliced by $50.00, and you know this in advance to Prime Day, think about ordering MORE from the manufacturer in anticipation of items selling out. If it weren't for that little 'gem.' I would have no issues with receiving a replacement in December.

Yep, December, I ordered this in September, and because of Prime Day, a replacement won't be available until December. It'll be well worth the wait because if this thing sounds great with FOUR speakers, just imagine all FIVE working.

284,"Imagine searching for your favorite song, it starts playing, and it's a different recording. It sounds off and not nearly as good. That is 3D music on the Studio in a nutshell.

I consider myself an ""amateur audiophile"" if that makes sense. I listen for subtle differences in the quality of same source music being played on different devices. To me the Alexa Studio is just another speaker. I do not find that it excels at anything. I have Amazon's HD Music and I found the 3D audio to be odd. It almost seemed to degrade overall sound quality in trade-off for trying to wow you with sound split between all its speakers. I tried it in several rooms with 3D songs from Amazon and at no point did I feel like the sound was around me. I had my wife walk me into the room blind folded after she randomly placed the Studio and had a 3D song playing. I turned in a circle several times and was able to point directly at the Studios location. To me that says it all. It makes sense really. You take a surround sound system calibration. It uses a mic placed at thr listeners location. It tests each speaker multiple times. The Studio uses its own mics, which are obviously not at the listeners location. At best it will be able to adjust sound for the acoustics of the room but its not going to be able to magically configure 3D sound. Also after initial calibration, it seamlessly calibrates itself when it is moved from room to room.

I have no hearing loss, so I keep my music low, but then I cant hear Alexa and you cannot adjust the AI volume separate from the music volume. That is why I rated the voice recognition low.

Bad move on Amazon's part I don't understand why you couldn't put the lights on the side of the device like the other echo devices all have. Just saying that's my one complaint with it.

Update: I’ve had the Studio for a few weeks now and it has developed a problem. It received a software upgrade a few days ago, and now, after playing a number of songs, it randomly starts making a loud unpleasant kind of burbling sound. If I say “Alexa, skip” it goes to the next song and plays properly. Then, some songs later, it burbles again. It is not any particular song file, and a song that made the noise will play properly if I say, “Alexa, play ‘song name’”. Amazon support is really nice, but apparently I am the only customer that has reported this. Of course, if they replace it, I will receive a refurbished unit; when I spent this kind of money a few weeks ago, I don’t want refurbished. They say they will escalate my problem to an engineer, so I will keep it for a while, but if they can’t fix it, back it goes. (I still really like the great sound quality when it isn’t burbling.)

It sounds great and looks nice but if you try to connect it to your other echo devices and create an everywhere group, only the echo that you placed the command on plays clearly and the others sound garbled and distorted. Again all play fine on their own but will not play smoothly on the everywhere group. I have made a call to Amazon for technical help and the person who answered could not help. They asked me to do all the usual things like reset each device. Nothing worked and she put in a ticket for me. Someone is supposed to call back within a few days!!

292,"Update 12/9/2020: I wanted to update my review after nearly 5 months of use. I am so pleased with this purchase. The sound quality is on a whole different level for me. It is crisp, clean, and powerful. We have enjoyed using the Echo Studio practically every day. It is especially fun when we have the grandkids over and we take turns telling Alexa to play music by various artists. Never a dull moment. We crank up the volume, dance, and act silly. So much fun. The power of this speaker is awesome and is not distorted when you crank it up.
My wife and I use it with the Fire TV Cube when watching movies or TV shows and the performance is so much better than the soundbar and woofer we had before. I am truly considering a second Echo Studio. Alexa is so polite.

Original review: I recently canceled cable and purchased Fire TV Cube to stream. The cube has decent sound but does not bring home theatre quality entertainment. I purchased the Echo Studio and Wow! The Echo Studio is great and integrates perfectly with Fire TV Cube and Alexa.
We enjoy movies with surround sound and booming audio. The 3D audio blew me away when listening to Amazon music. We actually tend to watch less TV because of the enjoyment of having the Echo Studio. Many evenings the wife and I will ask Alexa to play a variety of music while we chill. My wife will ask Alexa to play an upbeat song in the morning and force me to dance with her until the song is complete. Good excdercise and gets you moving in the morning before work. I highly recommend the Echo Studio for hours upon hours of entertainment.",5,0.9965,Positive,295
293,"I haven't taken any measurements nor done any rigorous a/b comparisons, but I will share my impressions of the Echo Studio after a month of use. I bought the speaker on impulse, to replace my still-working Echo in the hope of better sound quality and stronger amplification. The Studio hits both of those marks. It is heavier, louder, and has wider frequency response than the Echo. Positioned in a corner of a 15x20' room, it fills the room with music with volume to spare. It's not stereo, and I have not attempted to pair it with another Studio, so with eyes closed you can easily tell the source of the music -- I don't perceive the 3D, ""speaker-disappearing"" spatial effect. The Studio is controlled by the Alexa app, which furnishes a paltry 3-band equalizer to customize the sound. For me, I've kept the middle and treble sliders at zero and demoted the bass. WIthout this, the Studio is very ""boomy"" which may be to some folks liking, but not mine, especially for jazz and EDM listening. More frequency bands would be great. Since I bought the Studio for music, I don't have many comments on it as an Alexa device. It does seem to share the too-frequent ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet"" warnings that all of my Echo's have, and that's with the wi-fi router in the same room. Bottom line? The Studio is a nice step up for network music playout, especially if you have Spotify. It's not better than a 100w mid-fi stereo system, but it is more convenient than having to power multiple pieces of equipment on/off just to hear a few songs. You'll give it extra points if you use your Echo as a musical alarm clock, or speakerphone.",5,0.9747,Positive,295
294,"My first ""Alexa"" and I have it in my RV. I am absolutely loving it. Rich sound. Fills the space, utilizes low bandwidth which is important for me in an RV. I had a similar 'indoor/outdoor' speaker that was round for similar sound - the Soundcast Melody which is amazing but nearly 2x the price as the Echo Studio for the same sound quality. I also have used the 3.5mm jack at the bottom to connect to my computer. Overall, a great unit!",5,0.922,Positive,83
295,"I love the Echo product line! The speaker is phenomenal and sound quality is perfect.

The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is because even with a brand new smart TV with Alexa integration, every time I turn the TV on I have to manually connect the speaker with the TV. And if you don’t have a smart TV, you have to use the auxiliary/optical port which every time you use the voice recognition feature for Amazon Alexa, it mutes the line in and you can’t get it undone unless you unplug the audio cable and plug it back in.",4,0.9359,Positive,101
296,"Definitely NOT the quality I was expecting; I was hoping for much more. Especially taking into consideration the size, weight, and the fact this cannot run off any sort of battery power because it has no but in battery, I was thoroughly unimpressed.

I am no audiophile by any means, but for a speaker that usually runs around $200, I would at least expect it to hold up to the standards and qualities it advertises so much about.

Some key examples where is was lacking were: surround sound or 3D sound of any kind, loudness, and clarity. It was slightly better than the tv speakers in my 65"" 4K base line thinQ LG tv, but it was still exceptionally obvious that the sound was coming from the left hand side where I put the device (it is too large to go in front of the TV or it will block the picture).

In addition to this, I paid $680 about 2 years ago now for this TV. Considering its age and cost, I would assume this speaker would blow the internal TV speakers away, but they failed, horribly, to do so.

The only time I could justify using this is for loud music for a party in a mid sized living room. Otherwise, it has no use to me.

Maybe the 4th generation will have some great improvements, who knows.",2,0.845,Positive,230
297,"I don’t consider myself an audiophile but I love good sound. A pair of Studios seemed great value compared to buying a good pair of bookshelf speakers and a decent receiver/amp, or investing in Sonos or the closed off Homepods.

In short, the audio quality is mediocre to my ears and only shines when LOUD. I really wanted to recommend these, but if you want a flexible/high quality audio system, I would look elsewhere. Stereo pairing seems more of an afterthought in the Echo ecosystem, and this limitation is an unacceptable compromise for me.

Features
Alexa works as expected. Creating a stereo pair is easy. Connecting the pair to the Fire TV 4K is a breeze. The 3D features are gimmicky in my opinion and didn’t really add anything to the experience. Aesthetically, I was pleasantly surprised. These look good and build seems high quality.

My main complaint -- creating a stereo pair does not do what you might expect. Pairing does not unify the two Studios as a single and persistent stereo pair -- it merely tells Alexa that stereo playback is available for limited purposes -- namely, playback from qualifying subscription services or via the Fire TV.

Since the stereo pair breaks, you cannot stream music from your phone or the computer from any arbitrary app, and output to the stereo pair (unless you’ve connected to via the Amazon music app from the phone). I really hoped the technology would have been implemented in such a way that you can send audio to one and have it work with both in stereo. You cannot bluetooth or wired line in and maintain the stereo pairing. When scanning for available bluetooth devices, you see each speaker individually only and connecting will be mono to a specific speaker. I was aware of this limitation with respect to wired in, but I was disappointed to learn that bluetooth also breaks the stereo pair. At first, I thought it was user error but learned that this a long requested and ignored feature request across the Echo device line.

Stereo pairing works when connecting via Amazon Music from the iPhone. It takes about 10 seconds to connect and there’s a few seconds lag when controlling via the app, but on the whole it’s usable. Stereo pairing works when telling Studio to play music by voice. It’s not perfect. Often it will inexplicably stop playback or reduce volume. Sometimes playback won’t be in stereo and will come from one or the other speaker (noticeably when asking Alexa to play radio stations) -- but on the whole, it works as expected when working within the confines of the limited feature set. I appreciate being able to voice control these speakers, but I cannot recommend these over a more traditional wired hookup connected to an Echo Dot.

I am left with the impression that there wasn’t enough thought given to using these as an alternative to dedicated home audio devices. They are not suitable replacements for a wired or wireless stereo system. I understood there was no Airplay or equivalent wifi feature to select the pair as the audio output for a mobile/computer device, and I wrongly assumed these had bluetooth as an alternative.

Audio quality
Music sounds significantly better in stereo than mono, but even in stereo the quality is just okay. Sound is muddy and they lack detail I would expect at the price point for two of these. At first I thought one of Studios was broken -- I just couldn’t believe it was so unimpressive given the rave reviews and price point. The Studios start to impress when loud - it does not distort and detail comes alive. They easily fill my large bedroom, but they are lackluster for ordinary listening volumes. To my ears, the Homepods are far superior for audio quality.

I bought these mainly for music but being able to use a pair for TV speakers is a nice bonus if you have a compatible Fire TV.",2,0.9927,Positive,667
298,"Purchased in March of 2019, I paired this unit with the matching subwoofer. Sound quality is fine. Certainly not up to my old days of reading Stereo Review, but perfect for listening to a few tunes or overtures with dinner or late in the evening. The problem is the voice recognition. Up to 40% of the time when we ask for a tune we get ""Here's a station you might like."" Then our voices raise trying to get it to stop. One or two more tries and we finally get our selection. This does not portend to a quiet dinner or late night music listening. Avoid this device. Buy some quality powered speakers with a headphone jack or better yet a blue tooth connection. I have an Echo Input in my bath room with a small battery powered blue tooth speaker. It picks up every word I say, even with the shower running and the sound quality is fine. I love the Amazon Unlimited Music program, like having an endless jukebox in your home. But save yourself the trouble and find a better speaker system to enjoy the music.",3,0.981,Positive,189
299,"The Echo Studio is like my new best friend.

I can't say much about the 3D audio--it feels gimmicky to me--but that's not the reason to buy this speaker. It just sounds so much better than the other Echos. I had a 2nd generation Echo in my kitchen, and I set the Studio up in the living room. I hooked them up to play songs at the same time. Walking from the kitchen into the living room was a whole other world of sound. You can feel the thrum of the bass and the lower notes. In a single word, it sounds terrific-- so good I'm considering replacing all my Echo devices with Studios. That may be taking things too far--the Studio is a rather big device, be warned--but the sound is so amazing I miss it when I'm in other rooms.

Definitely consider the Studio in lieu of the more expensive offerings from Sonos or Bose. As far as I'm concerned, this speaker can't sound any better, and integration with Alexa is top-notch. Plus, you can form music groups so that multiple Echo devices can play your music together. I love this functionality and use it all the time.

300,"In just two weeks I went from a free echo 3rd generation dot (with a Sirius subscription), to two more dots, a echo 3rd generation, and now the echo studio since Best Buy and Amazon had a one day sale. My entire condo is now a symphony hall and I've been in heaven ever since. Each echo does its job as promised and because you get what you pay for, each upgrade of echo produces higher quality sounding music. The echo studio has a 3.5 mm line in, so I was able to connect my 18 year old Panasonic plasma tv with deteriorating speakers into the echo studio and the sound is incredible. I can also use the same line in to connect to my high resolution audio portable music player (which I use at the gym) and hear lossless quality sound from the echo studio...and...tell Alexa to ""play the music everywhere "" so all my echoes produce music throughout my home. I don't ask Alexa many questions but I'm just 100% satisfied with my home being a symphony hall. I hope all my echoes hold up over time, but I'm content knowing I have great value for what I paid for. My first echo dot is connected to my home theater in my living room, my other dot is in the kitchen on the wall in a echo holder, my echo 3rd generation is in the guest bedroom and my echo studio is in my master bedroom where my older plasma TV is on the wall.

I am trying to decide if I should keep it or return it. I will probably keep since the voice recognition in the E Studio is very good. Its really only an sub par average speaker. It does appear that older speaker tech was and is much better than many new speaker. Speaker is a 2 and voice recognition is a 4, so an average of 3.

302,"I bought this to replace my original Echo that was in the living room. It is the main area where we listen to music in our house and I wanted something that could produce decent sound quality with range. This is where the Echo Studio comes in and excels. The rest of it's Alexa capabilities are just like any of the other Echos that I have used and works well. It's microphones and ability to pick up requests has improved over the original Echo, but that's not what I bought it for. It's speakers is where it really shines. I use it to play music from Pandora, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. There are notes and instruments in songs I have never heard before on other speakers, which goes to show how well this thing performs.

The product is well built and has some heft to it. It's base has a non-slip material to it, so it does stay in place. The activity ring on the top is not as visible when lit as the other Echo units, which is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes it a little more difficult to see when it is listening/responding to you. On the other hand, it doesn't distract you when you catch it lighting up out of the corner of your eye or late at night.

I haven't tried the 3D audio capabilities, so I don't have much to say about that.

The only thing that may make this sound better is pairing it with a subwoofer and a second Echo Studio for true stereo.

I currently us an echo dot in my bathroom to save counter space. Amazon it's time to make a better quality speaker, in a reasonable size, that is safe in moderately high humidity!

Alexa has become a member of the family. In one year, I now have 3 Echo dots, 2 Echo Show 8 (one was gifted to my mom), 1 Echo Show 5, 1 Echo Original, and now the Echo Studio.

By far the Echo Studio has the best sound quality, especially for larger spaces and outdoors. I plan to use the Studio for Outdoor movie nights with a portable projector.

The only con that I have is I have not figured out how to ""synchronize"" my Echoes. The Studio and Echo Show sometimes get confused. I use the Show in the Kitchen Area and the Studio is in the Family Space near the TV.

Overall I love the whole Echo Family. I live with a disability that causes chronic fatigue and severe shortness of breath. I am able to communicate with my kids using my Echo without having to over exert myself.

We organize our shopping list on the Echo. Then use the Alexa app to retrieve the list while at the store.

The Echo connects to my Chevrolet vehicle which is not just convenient but also really cool. LOL.

308,"I've been on the fence about trying one of these since they were announced, but finally took advantage of the sale and thought maybe it could be a nice replacement for my home theater sound. Well, setup was nice and easy, and the demo sounded great. Although I did note that in order to REALLY get the effect you have to have it center screen. Which means if I keep this I'm going to have to raise my television a few more inches so this behemoth doesn't get in the way. But I would do that...if it worked. I've had it 3 days, used it 2, had to reset it and set it back up at least 7 times so far. Most because I have 2 wifi connections in my home (one for me and one for guests), and although I set this up with the main one and NEVER gave it the password for the guest wifi, it's already in Amazon so it kept switching over. And there is no way in the app or anywhere else to change wifi connections without wiping it and starting over fresh. This happened even after I went in and told Amazon to forget the guest wifi altogether. It's also just come disconnected from the Echo Cube randomly, resulting in having to go into the app and unpair and repair the home theater setup. I haven't made it through a single movie yet without it having to be reset. Sound is great, as long as you have it centered. The home theater is great - when it works.

The sound separation was not as good as just a simple left end right speaker set up. The bass at set levels was lacking so I needed to adjust that in the app. Even with the Ultra HD Amazon music songs and Dolby Atmos movies, there wasn't a lot of blow you away-ism.
A bothersome thing was that in the app they have a setting to pair the Echo Studio with a remote. I thought this would be very helpful because I have an Echo Show 8 next to were I sit and to voice activate the Studio with the remote would save some ""alexa"" confusion. Also it would be good to use the volume controls on the remote for the speaker. After many tries to pair a new remote. I could not get it to work. So I called Amazon support. They told me that I could not use the 4K remote and to use any remote the Studio could not be pairs with any other group or Echo devices because it uses bluetooth and only one blurtooth could be paired at at a time.

One thing to be aware of the default sound setting is the 3D space sound and unless specifically listening to this type of music will probably want to turn off the 3D space sound using Alexa App. At least that was my preference anyway. If you buy these don't review or judge until you've played around with 3D sound setting.
Also, like the equalizer options to adjust. Stereo pairing was easy and works great.
Have already had a couple neighbors over to listen and the 'wow' reaction is fun to see.
These speakers also have the ability to stream the hi fidelity larger file sizes that Amazon offers at an extra price. I'm currently trying out this feature. Sounds great at the regular industry standard file sizes. I think I do notice a little bit of a difference with the large hi fidelity streaming. Nice to have the option for the higher bit streams.
The bass is adequate with the 2 Echo Studios, however I'm going ahead and ordering the echo sub to get the full effect. I'm told you can do the stereo pairing of the 2 studios and also stream to the sub as well. So should be exciting when I get it setup.

Sometimes when Alexa speaks the volume suddenly drops to a level that I can't hear and then returns to correct volume when I make a new request/question.

Sometimes when I enter the room after being gone for a while, Alexa can't understand a simple request like ""Den Light On"" (even if I consciously pronounce the words clearly). It may take two or three tries to get the command to work. This is frustrating when you have your arms full of objects.

There are numerous questions that Alexa can't answer when I ask them. I can then speak to Google Assistant on my cell phone and get a precise answer.

Alexa system keeps losing color for bedroom light. I set it to red and then suddenly it turns back to bright white at some random point. This is very frustrating when you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. Red doesn't fully wake me up. White wakes me up completely.

The only thing I wished for was the unit had more power. Since the replaced a 13 year old JBL ipod capable room speaker (was twice the price), the volume is not as loud.

319,"I just initiated my 2nd Echo Studio factory reset and figured it was time I spoke my mind about this product. I was truly excited to get one of these. I own an array of Echo products including 2 Echo shows, a 1st generation Echo and an echo dot. I live in a semi-smart home (mostly lights) and while this isn't my number one hobby, I'd like to think than I'm an enthusiast. But, Sadly, this device, or at least my particular unit, is a lemon. Most recently 'she' lost connection to the internet. I tried restarting a few times but that didn't help. This is a pretty regular occurrence, but usually a reboot fixes it. Music playback can also be problematic. This device is in my bedroom, my wife and like to enhance our intimate encounters with a little music. Well, let me tell you, nothing really sets the mood like random playback failures. A change in mid song, or long delays between tracks can be very distracting. I would be more forgiving if this where through Spodify, but I subscribed to Amazon's Music streaming service just so I could take advantage of the Atmos feature. To be clear, when it works, it's great. But more often than not, there is something buggy happening.",2,0.9168,Positive,215
320,"I've had this for about a month now and it is not impressive. The smaller dots work better when it comes to voice recognition and reliability. If I have a power outage or I reset my router for any reason, I have to spend a few HOURS trying to get the studio to work again. Yesterday I finally got it set up again after I had to turn off power for a home project. It took two attempts at resetting it before the app recognized the studio again, and then it recognized it as a SECOND studio and I couldn't get anything to work from the app to the studio.

It also doesn't appear to pick up voice commands as well as the dots and flexes. I can stand beside it and ask for something, and my dot or flex in other rooms respond while this doesn't acknowledge that I've asked something of it.

Finally, the Alexa app for Android is sloooooooow. Any actions have a long lah time between the request and the output, and the app itself is sluggish.

The sound is certainly better than the dot, etc., but it's not worth the hassle to get it working.",2,0.1154,Positive,200
321,"First and foremost if you are looking for standalone Bluetooth speaker, then the Echo Studio is a must buy. You'll be extremely happy and at 200 dollars its a home run on value and performance. Highly recommended for that aspect.

Now if you are using it as a home theater system, that is a whole another story. Let me first say I was intrigued by the Echo Studio because of the Dolby Atmos, 3D immersive sound, and just the whole complimentary features I would get being a Fire TV Cube 2nd gen user. First impressions, lets be honest, the Studio is big and ugly. But guys we can get over that, my wife hated the look of it as soon as I brought it into the house. It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.

Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.

Then through out the night we proceed.
Flood gates of frustration opens...

Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.

Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.

Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.

Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.

Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.

Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.

Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.

The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.

I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.

I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.
I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.",3,0.9977,Positive,1009
322,"Basically, it is a standard Echo with a large Speaker attached. But for the money that large speaker is really great. Bass that thumps but doesn't overpower the high end. It uses a variation of direct reflection technology to spread the sound through the room.

323,"I bought two of these. (For music you really need two speakers). With Amazon Music HD, the sound is good. But.....I still don't think it matches a traditional stereo setup with an amp/receiver powering passive speakers. What I wish Amazon would do with the HD service is offer an amp with the app integrated in. And with a DAC that can play the full 192/24 resolution for songs in that format. Power that through a pair of passive Klispch or Polk speakers and you might be in music heaven. You would get the best of both worlds: the hi fi sound of a traditional stereo with the convenience and cost effectiveness of music streaming. Come on Amazon......do it!",3,0.9628,Positive,118
324,"I have purchased eight Echos for my family and others since its debut. Being an audiophile, when I heard about the Echo Studio, I KNEW I had to have one. Dolby Atmos, 3D High Definition Music?? Yes sir!! Read great reviews and not-so-great reviews. Still ... I had to have one. And I wish I had listened to the not-so-great reviews.

The sound quality is maybe slightly better than the Echo Show. I haven't heard anything yet that sounded like ""Dolby Atmos"". As far as 3D?? That's a joke. I purchased a subscription to Amazon Music HD and nothing there sounds any better than normal Spotify on the first generation Echo.

Because I'm a fool, I will hold onto it for now on the slim chance that I'll buy another when they come down in price as I've read THAT'S the way to listen to it and I can imagine it'd sound slightly better with two speakers simultaneously rather than just one speaker. I dunno. Maybe I'm an idiot and a glutton for punishment. We'll see.

In the meantime I say do NOT buy this. Get the biggest Echo Show you can afford and enjoy that instead.",3,0.9604,Positive,197
325,"I bought this to replace my original Echo that I bought in pre-releaase in 2015 that has sat and worked away as a loyal soldier in the kitchen all of this time without an issue playing hundreds if not thousands of hours of music and answered uncounted numbers of questions...

WHAT AN UPGRADE! The sound of music out of this device in the poorly located position (for a music device) for the Echo in the kitchen (tucked in next to a small convection toaster) is amazing. I am listening to Ed Sheeran songs on it right now, while it sits in the kitchen, and I am in the living room 20+ feet away and it is crystal clear with actual bass.

Configuration was child's play. I unplugged the Echo, I plugged in the Studio, I started the Alexa app, clicked a few prompts, it went through some sound tests and within 3-4 minutes it was up and running playing a Classic Rewind channel for me for validation tests.

Now I have to replace the Echo in my office with one of these Studios as I regularly listen to music there as well.

Great job Amazon! :)",5,0.9747,Positive,196
326,"You would think, that spending $200 on a speaker would be a guaranteed way to listen to music but it never works. It'll play 1 song and then stop and then I can never get it to play another. I've tried Bluetooth-ing my phone to it and still, will not work. If you're not planning on listening to music, everything else works fine. But that was the whole point of me buying it.",1,-0.0139,Neutral,73
327,"I'm a self-professed audiophile. Dolby Atmos processing is critical to get the front tweeter working, so it's on by default for most stereo content I'm throwing thru this. Don't buy this for home theatre unless you've got a Fire TV stick. Sounds good in any large room. Overkill for small college sized single bed bedrooms.

Atmos Processing reduces the overall clarity of the music, but the increase in the soundstage is a worthwhile tradeoff, even though it dilutes the intention of the original mixes (unless you're using Amazon Music HD, with its 3D mixes.) It makes the entire wall surface (at least, above the speaker) sound like it's emanating sound, which is spectacular.

Works great as a computer speaker, I use it as my primary computer speaker. The start of sudden sounds get cut off a little, but once it realizes it's receiving line-in input, it works spectacularly. Would recommend as the best combination computer speaker / Amazon Echo device.

Stereo Separation seems dependent upon the room. You don't get the distinct directionality of stereo speakers, but rather a vague feeling of left or right along the rectangle of sound the device creates.

Voice recognition is variable. Sometimes if it hears you clearly, it doesn't need to duck the audio, which is neat. However, this is 50/50. This is the best voice recognition in any voice assistant I've ever used.",5,0.9932,Positive,230
328,"The sound is absolutely amazing. I was completely blown away by It! The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because of connectivity issues. I was under the impression that I could use the studio as a center/main channel and use two dots as side speakers for surround but apparently that's not an option at the moment, I was told the studio could only pair with another studio. Well, somehow I did get it to pair with both dots (just not simultaneously) and if they could just update the devices to work together seamlessly then it would be a truly versatile sound system. But without that capability, it's still just another Alexa, not a sound system.",4,0.8508,Positive,117

Then I turned off Stereo Spatial Emhancement in Alexa App settings and maxed out the equalizer. After a few minutes it started to sound great! Bass was deep and tight, mids and trebble were clear!

The problem is it won’t connect for at least 5 to 10 minutes after turning on the tv. I have tried every option to try to get this issue resolved. I don’t have this issue when I go through a mini toslink but I have to unpair it from my fire stick for echo studio to do so. If paired it will only speak to the fire stick through WiFi regardless if you plug in an optical cable.

It is also inconsistent on sound levels for music, alarms, reminders and notifications, seemingly randomly announcing things at abnormally loud volume s levels.

I don’t have speakers like these in my house but I wanted to set up a hub to control lights etc. in my apartment so two birds is what I thought. Especially since I don’t want to have a full blown sound system in my small apartment. I’ve had the older generation Echo dot and it sounded terrible. I ordered this Studio when it first came to market expecting an upgrade but was pretty disappointed. It’s rather flat sounding in my opinion hence the mediocre review. I really should have returned it.

In any event, I am giving away my old Dot after receiving the new generation Echo yesterday. At a hundred bucks it sounds better than the Studio. So now I have the new Echo in my bedroom and Studio in living room. Both handle voice commands well. But I’d recommend the new Echo over the Studio. The sound is open and airy. Highs are crisp and the bass is punchy in a smaller footprint. The sound on the Studio is just blah. Everything else works fine so 3 stars.",3,0.9001,Positive,208
336,"The speaker is as expected.
I had to move it around a bit an re-calibrate it a few times.
If you are in the same boat, hold down the action button, it will go into setup mode, showing an orange ring.
DON'T let go of the button and keep holding it down beyond this for a wee bit more.
It will then kick of the whole process of starting up as it did the first time and do the wall bouncing thingy.

Anyways, my gripe is not the speaker but the bulb that came packaged with the purchase.
I already got a Philips hue bulb in a previous Echo purchase and that works fine. No need for a Philips hue hub, just the built in zigbee hub that the Echo plus (which I have) or this Echo Studio has.

However, this bulb does require a Philips hue hub.
What numb nuts is not paying attention to this in Amazon when they put these items for sale as a package?
Why not the Philips hue bulb that works with a zigbee hub that the Echo you are purchasing has built into it?

Other than that, the speaker works as expected. I do prefer to turn off the 'Stereo Spatial Enhancement' under the audio settings for the Echo Studio in the Alexa app under 'Audio settings'.",5,-0.7149,Negative,224
337,"I was actually looking for ways to improve the sound on my TV and saw a promo of the Studio. I went ahead and order one and got it quickly, set it up in my master and played around with it. I have Amazon Music, played some of their 3D demo music and was sold on Rocket Man. Immediately upgraded to Prime 3D Music. Connected it to the TV and pulled up Blade Runner 2049, Thor Dark World and Avengers EndGame and on a single Studio was wowed by the sound filling my master. So withing days, I order a second Studio and upon arrival, moved both into our family room and now have it fully integrated with our large TV. That room has 26 foot ceilings and opens to several other rooms but the sound reached everywhere. It also sets up with left and right speakers and you can hear some really crazy subtle noises that I don't even remember hearing in the theater. I now stream every app I can through the Fire Stick (get with the program on HBO Max, Amazon!!!)

As for just music, the bass can be a bit overwhelming and there is not a lot of control in the equalizer on the Alexa app. I don't claim to be an audiophile but I own thousands of songs via iTunes and know good v great sound quality. Amazon is better than good and on most songs, especially those that are in 3D, the quality is pretty fantastic. But I also really like heavy metal and given drums and bass dominance in bands like Tool, the really deep tones can be a little overwhelming. But Tool also has tracks in 3D and the nuances that sneak through the heavy bass are really interesting. On more pop or pop rock music, it's not as prevalent and really quite enjoyable. We'll see if I can survive the holiday season streaming my wife's Christmas music.

If you subscribe to Amazon Music, I recommend pairing this with a TV whether you intend to use it for a sound system or not. With Fire TV, the remote syncs to the Studio and controls TV and speakers. It makes access to the music catalog and all of their HD and Ultra HD quality music fairly simple. There could be some improvements like better access to genres and then sub sections within but overall a decent way to get artists or albums to play. They also have quite a few playlists pre-created, some of which are pretty good.

Overall, for $400 to get 2 Studio's and a couple more Hue lights, I can't think of a better way to get a serious TV sound improvement (that really will rattle the rafters) and a much better than good smart speaker.",5,0.9985,Positive,466
338,"It's important to say that my Echo-Studio was a gift. I did not seek out and purchase this item for myself. The giver knew my taste for classical music and for this it was a well-chosen gift. There are so many reviews of the Echo Studio that I can only say this device does what it claims to do. Initially, I did not like the non-directional sound, but the longer I've used it, the more I see the benefit of the room-filling sound, especially when one needs to get up and move around. The sound is uniform at almost any point in the room. The Studio is sturdy and heavy, which means no rattles or buzzing when playing music at a higher volume level.

Is the sound as good as advertised? Frankly, it *is* good, though not as good as my old Bose Mini which has superb clarity and a wide stereo sound stage. Then the Bose does not have the connectivity and other features of the Echo Studio. I tried Amazon 3D audio and was only mildly impressed. It wasn't so superior as to induce me to subscribe.

Then, it must be said that the Echo Studio, like all Amazon devices, is at some level a conduit for enticing one to buy more from Amazon. Here it's more subtle, but once Alexa learns the owner's voice, it can be used to purchase items from Amazon by verbal command. I wave no red flag. I've been an Amazon customer for over two decades with no desire to end that relationship.

The only negative I have experienced so far was a verbal notification from Amazon. Alexa asked me to review the Echo Studio! I answered with an emphatic NO! Please, Amazon, take note! We get spam by email, spam by text, and if spam starts to come by Alexa on my devices, I will shut them down.

Alexa is a primary feature of the Echo Studio, I must say that it can be difficult to get her to fetch the music one wants. If you seek Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, no problem. As a subscriber to Amazon Music Unlimited, I ought to have access to millions of 'songs'. When I asked to hear Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, I got the overture to the Barber of Seville by Rossini. Granted, Figaro is the protagonist in both works, but multiple tries to play the correct music caused Alexa to shut down! I later searched for the music I wanted on the Amazon Music app on my mobile and there were multiple versions of the opera to enjoy. Alexa may be handy but she is no deus ex machina.",5,0.9812,Positive,448

The audio is great compared to all other Echo devices.

The home theater feature is technically very exciting and connects seamlessly with the fire TV, too bad that sometimes audio skips and with some apps the audio is a few milliseconds delayed. The audio skipping made the feature unusable for movies. When you have this feature on if you play music say from Spotify, that also turns your TV on and plays Spotify from your fire TV. This is also unreliable as sometimes the fire tv doesn’t actually turn on OR it turns on but it doesn’t open the app.

We even went to buy an optical cable and this also has two different issues a) you can only change the volume with your voice and b) audio is ALSO unreliable is it sometimes suddenly completely mutes and you have to unplug the cable and when you turn te TV or program off you get some sort of residual audio.

I just honestly don't get all of these reviews. The equalizer in the app to change the sound is worthless with very basic adjustments. I know since I spent a lot of time trying to get this speaker to sound decent. The vocal's are muted at the expense of the bass and you can't pull them to the front very well, vocals as you are use to hearing them on the radio or CD or Album are not present. And, I subscribed to Amazon's HD music trial to see if that would make the difference and it just didn't. I have a UE Boom speaker I've been very satisfied with but thought I'd try this after reading all the reviews and it was on sale. Honestly, now that I have the HD trial stream the UE even sounds better than before and you can get this regularly for under $100.00.

If this is Amazon's attempt at decent sound, they have quite a way to go. The mid-range sound on these is very muddy. This is not high- fidelity quality. It's OK for what it is, and the stereo arrangement is sufferable. Hooking up just one, however, was not adequate for my background ""easy listening"" purposes. I was on the edge of sending them back, but, I love being able to bounce all around the history of music just by asking Alexa to play this or play that, or asking WHat song is this, or Who is playing this song. That part, I love. But of course you have to pay around 150 a year or so for Amazon music access.",3,0.9724,Positive,191
343,"The sound quality of this device is the real deal! For a stand alone speaker it sounds beautiful with rich mid-low to even a decent treble! It has okay performance with the low ranges but it certainly would benefit greatly from the echo sub pairing.

The 3D audio is a really fun gimmick though it will never truly replace a true surround sound system because everyone's house/ room is going to be different and there are also so few options to really take advantage of the 3D audio anyways.

The offline voice recognition and zigbee hub is absolutely great! I love being able to control my lights almost instantly without it having to access an online database.

The major drawback that I have is I really wanted to connect my echo studio to my firestick 4k to take advantage of the Dolby Atmos Plus audio of both devices! This unfortunately cannot happen because the studio cannot handle streaming of video and streaming the audio at the same time. (yes, my internet is fine. everyother device in my house can handle streaming 4k) I tried everything and talked to representatives for over 6 cumulative hours trying to diagnose this. It handles streaming amazon music and streaming the album to the tv just fine, but video is where it falls apart. Amazon sent me a replacement device but it still was dropping audio literally every second. Like the packet for the other half of the audio was dropped in communications and so it clips in and out (But not stereoscopically so). This is a huge bummer for me because I really got this device to have a decent sounding wireless speaker to go with the TV but at this point I just wish I could hardwire the Studio to the Firestick 4k and still retain the Dolby Atmos Plus quality (Which you can't in a hardwire from the TV to the Studio, it just treats it like any other speaker).

Overall, this speaker is great as a super Alexa device! If you're looking for a huge but excellent sounding Echo device for a room in your house and are not wanting to use it for streaming movie audio, this speaker is amazing! If you're hoping to make use of the Dolby Atmos Plus for your FireTV though, I'd say to save your money and look elsewhere.",3,0.998,Positive,394
344,"I don't know how you can beat the sound of a stereo pair of Echo Studio's for the money. I ordered 2 and have mine set up as a stereo pair. Will they fill up a large room at concert volume? No but for a smaller room/apartment or for a whole house or secondary system they are amazing. I don't have them paired with a Fire TV so can't speak to that but my wife and I listen to them by streaming Amazon Music HD and I really do hear things in songs particularly on the high end I've never heard before. They are so good you tell the difference between an HD stream and an MP3 service. I don't consider myself a true audiophile but I do spend a lot of money on 2 channel and home theatre gear and I'm very impressed with the sound of these speakers. I had them set up in under 10 minutes. The Echo Sub is sold out and not available at the time of this review but I have pre-ordered it and I'm really looking forward to adding it to the speaker group.

Note to Amazon: You have a great product here. I would suggest making a larger scale version of these - say 1.5 or 2 times the size for people who want to fill up a bigger space. I'd gladly pay more for something like that.",5,0.9864,Positive,236
345,"Shockingly good sound from such a relatively small device. Setup is mostly easy. Had some issues setting up home entertainment system mode with fire stick. It did not work independently and respond to Alexa requests. Had to remove, reinitialize etc and then it worked. Was frustrating. I have two of these in different rooms and one was effortless the other a pain.
Got over it quickly when I put on a movie and it filled the room with 3D-ish sound and good low end. I’m sure if I put 2 together with a sub it would be killer.
I use the fire stick for everything so it isn’t as limiting as I thought it would be.
I have a DVD player (rarely use) and Nintendo switch and use the tv sound. Not enough of a deal breaker to make me get a big clunky sound bar. Kids don’t care that switch sound comes from tv.
Wish list item would be ability to re-calibrate room sensing thing without reinstalling. I moved it around a bit and it doesn’t feel like it automatically fixed the positioning.",4,0.6597,Positive,184
346,"I bought the Echo Studio for two reasons. 1) good sound 2) Echo Plus SmartHome zigbee hub

The sound is great but the SmartHome features are half baked.

It supports many Zigbee bulbs and motion sensors, however the user interface (alexa app and voice control) does not support switchs or any tactile controls. For example Ikea sells a Zigbee Bulb and wireless dimmer switch kit. Both the dimmer control and the bulb can be paired with echo, but the user interface only recognizes the bulb. Amazon has not built progamatic support for taktile controls.

Also there is no IF THEN OR logic available for SmartHome routines. There is time controls but that is limited.

I bought a Linkind Brand Motion Sensor and use it to trigger a routine. If I enter the kitchen anytime between 6:00 am and 7:30 am it plays the morning news and turns on a light. This is great because the routine is time and motion based.",3,0.7921,Positive,161
347,"When the echo products went on a limited time sale, I purchased the Studio to replace my Echo 2nd gen. The setup was effortless as it recognized my network and added itself via the app. To my disappointment, I immediately realized that the mid and upper range was directional. The speaker was in a central location on top of a kitchen counter almost in the middle of a large open space (kitchen, den, and dining areas). When I walked around the unit the sound was not uniform. For a few hours, I contemplated returning it, then I moved the studio to a corner of my 11"" x 29"" enclosed lanai with the unit supported about a foot off of the floor. What a difference! Now I love it! The bass is so much deeper than the Echo 3rd gen and voices sound more lifelike. Where you place this unit matters. When you find the right spot, the sound quality is wonderful. I gave the studio 4 stars because I could not use it in the location that I purchased it for. For that spot, I bought an Echo 3rd generation.",4,0.8168,Positive,190
348,We wanted to like this BUT we had so much difficulty connecting especially when you have multiple devices. We also got the Echo Sub which only worked when my husbands phone was connected to it but for the life of me I could not get the sub to work when connected to my phone. This device only seemed to work well with Amazon Music services. I could not get this to work with Apple Music at all or any other services. It got so frustrating we decided to return it. We are pretty technically savy and this was the most annoying products to use compared to other wireless Bluetooth players. Lots of work still needs to be done to improve the technology.,1,-0.0049,Neutral,122
349,"Bought to use in Florida room. When listening to music, there isn't a huge difference between listening to my original Echo device. Would probably sound better if paired with another, but then for the price of two, might as well buy a Bose.",3,0.5816,Positive,43
350,"Everything about the Echo Studio is great except that it can't wake me up in the morning to near perfect sound. I have an additional Echo and Echo Sub which together combine for fantastic, near perfect stereo/3D music. But...the alarm (wake up) function will only allow the music to come from the Echo Studio. Granted, I can wake up to ""good"" sound from just the Studio alone. The drawback here is that I have two different equalizer preferences; one for just the Studio and one for the entire system so this solution does not meet my idea of perfection since only one equalizer setting can be stored at a time. I have since moved my Studio and Sub to another room and have fantastic sound there and have reverted to using my Echo Show 10"" as my alarm clock pending a hopeful Amazon upgrade.

An additional note is that the Echo Studio sounds great by itself but sounds MUCH better when paired with an Echo Sub.",4,0.9686,Positive,166
351,Over all this speaker is amazing. I have a Sonos before this and wanted something with more Alexa features as well as well rounded sound. None of the other Amazon speakers were as good as Sonos in audio quality. I played with a demo of this in Best Buy before I pre-ordered this. And I have no regrets. My ONLY problem is I prefer Apple Music and she doesn’t play the best all the time with it. Sometimes I’ll be randomly disconnected and have sign in again. The speaker itself is incredible.,5,0.9726,Positive,92
352,"I bought this smart speaker as prime day deal, In my mind I had more expectations that are not reached up to the mark that's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars . Actually I bought this speaker for my projector and expected good home theater sound but its not as expected but when we see it as induvial smart speaker then its good.
For my projector I used Amazon fire stick and amazon speaker. As ""Smart"" devices FireStick should integrate(connect) with speaker but that is lagging. Thats the Alexa integration given 4 stars.
Coming to sound quality. No doubt sound quality is very good but at this price range we should have more volume of sound. I'm using 8 or 9 pts of sound out of10 pts to enjoy the music.. Actually by using 6 or 7 points volume we should get expected volume level.
Overall product is good if it is around 120 to 130 price range if more than that... better find alternative if you have concern particularly about volume levels.",4,0.9855,Positive,174
353,This is a well built and great sounding speaker for the cost. Amazon is really competing with the big brands with this one. Still evaluating the 3D music but Amazon Ultra HD music sounds fantastic on this speaker. Plenty loud and clear. Can't go wrong with this speaker.,5,0.9526,Positive,48
354,"I had a pair of Bose speakers in my bedroom, voices were always difficult to decipher at the lower volume levels needed in the bedroom to keep peace with my wife. After hearing several speakers in the $200-$400 range I decided on the Echo, brought it home, hooked it up (easy peasy). I'm amazed at the clarity of the voices coming from this speaker even at the lowest levels. Exactly what I needed. I paid $169 for this and it came with a free light bulb, what else could I ask for?
Update! This speaker sits next to my right ear. I'm watching football last night and I hear cheering from the left side of the room!! Thinking I'm hearing things I muted the speaker, sure enough, voices were coming from the right but the sound was bouncing off the walls, all the while at a low volume level, this is a good-sized Master bedroom. The separation is almost as good as the 10K system in my living room. Love this speaker!!",5,0.9493,Positive,172
355,"The best speak system that I've ever owned! The pairing in Home Theater node via Amazon Fire Cube Gen1 was sketchy at first but it seemed to have sorted itself out. I can hear things in old movies and shows that I have never heard before! Often, while watching a show, one of the cats will think they heard something in the house and immediately respond but it's only the speakers. That's house realistic they sound!!

These have excellent bass. The sound quality and richness is better than anything I have ever owned, hands down.

Complaints? I don't know. I wish I could ask it to place music without flipping on the TV. It's cool to see the lyrics though.

The Echo Studio has incredible microphones. They are better than any Echo device. I could be in another room and they hear me better than the Echo that's in the room where I'm at.

Not cheap but worth every penny. Honestly? Now I want more for the bedroom.",5,0.9791,Positive,168
356,I ordered this during Amazon Deal Days so I got it for a decent price. I think if I would have paid the full price I would have been more disappointed. It is a large speaker with a small footprint. The sound is good and they made sure to dial back the volume level a bit so it does not distort at full volume. Set up is easy as could be and takes only a few minutes to get set up and running. Voice recognition is good is a lot better than the smaller speakers. It is not my go-to speaker when I want to Rock but as a daily driver for when I want to just listen to a podcast or stream music for background music.,4,0.7707,Positive,127
357,"The first official Echo device to feature really great sound. I’ve been looking so long for an Alexa-integrated high-quality speaker, since the Echo and Dot don’t quite achieve that for me, and the fantastic Dolby tech integrated into the speaker pulled me towards the Studio (plus, unlike non-Amazon devices, this being an Echo device means it’s backed by Amazon’s excellent support team. If you’re looking for a speaker with great sound and worth the price, I’d highly recommend this one.",5,0.9729,Positive,80
358,"Pros:
- Sounds excellent! Incredibly good sound! Tight bass, excellent clarity good mdis, and great highs. I am a picky sound person and this really sounds good! So good!!!!

- Aesthetics - Looks good! I like the space underneath it. It looks cool and modern!

- Buttons are high quality

Cons:
- I have the first generation echo and I think the mic pics up my voice better for waking up on the first generation echo

- I wish the notification light was not recessed and brighter. This sits on my breakfast bar and you can not really see when the unit is activated. On my first gen echo, the light was clearly visible.

- I miss the physical round knob for volume that was on the first gen echo. It is so much easier to adjust volume on the first gen echo with the round knob versus the buttons on the echo.

Overall, I am really happy with this purchase. The sound is just incredible! I am going to buy a second unit for my bedroom. Amazon really knows how to make a good product! Way better than the Google Home products that I have.",5,0.9949,Positive,196
359,"I started with an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and an Echo Input (connected to my stereo receiver). I have since added 2 more Echo Dots, an Echo Flex with Motion Sensor, and now the Echo Studio. The Echo Studio was very easy to setup, looks beautiful, and fills our living room with nice sound. My one complaint is the microphone doesn't seem to hear commands very well. Our Echo Dot upstairs will often pickup commands said downstairs, but the Echo Studio seems to have trouble hearing commands said in the same room. The only other feature I wish it had was Apple Airplay 2.

I created a speaker group with the Studio and Echo Input so that I can play music ""downstairs"" in multiple rooms. I also created a routine that will turn off all music on all Echo devices, cause sometimes Alexa just gets confused and starts playing out of the wrong device. So far I have found it very easy to use and very flexible.",4,0.9303,Positive,167
360,"The good: The sound is good, not great, even when paired in stereo mode with another Echo Studio and an Echo Sub. I also think they look pretty cool, although my wife disagrees.

The bad: The price is much too high for what you get. The sound quality is good, but for $200 I expect something that sounds much better, cleaner, and with more depth. The ""Alexa"" smart assistant feature is terrible. It can barely hear me and often requires me to repeat a command 3 or so times (which is much worse than even my original (beta) Echo v1. These things are huge (about the size of a volleyball) and are difficult to place around the home, especially when paired with another Echo Studio and an Echo Sub. I really expected much better, richer sound quality for the price. Considering what you can get for the cost of two Echo Studios and an Echo Sub in the traditional speaker market, I'm pretty disappointed with the sound quality, and I'm not even an Audiophile. Finally, it doesn't look like you can use these as TV speakers unless you have one of the newer Amazon Fire TV devices. I expected these to play sound for my TV, including my Roku, PS4, and other video devices, even if that was limited to stereo quality sound, but these lack that capability apparently.",2,0.8567,Positive,229
361,"The Echo Plus is a fairly ""bass"" heavy speaker. Like lots of its competitors, they emphasize bass, so you think you're getting great sound from a small speaker. The Studio certainly has an impressive woofer, but it delivers a much more even range across the spectrum of the music being played. So that should be great, right? Well, that depends on what you're playing. If you ask Alexa to play ""best of 3D Music"" (which Amazon will keep reminding you to do) - OMG - it's fantastic. But then check on the price of a subscription to 3D Music, and not so fantastic. Regular music through Amazon Music Unlimited is a lot flatter. But then I do a bluetooth to my phone and play from my YouTube Music Premium account, and it sound great. So I can't help but wonder why Amazon Music sounds worse than that. It seems to be a push for you to get the 3D Music subscription. That's why I give 4 stars. Otherwise it works well as an Alexa device and the mics are very sensitive.

By the way Amazon - time for some new ""wake word"" options. You want us to load up on devices that end up being close to one another, and yet you have 4 wake words, and 2 of those are not easy to say.",4,0.989,Positive,225

MAYBE if it was in a perfectly square room it might sound better? i’m not a fan of the “stereo spatial enhancement”, you lose things in the music. with that enhancement turned off it still doesn’t sound that great, it’s very mid heavy. you really only get good rich bass on songs that are already bass heavy otherwise you don’t get much at all. The songs that are mastered in 3-D don’t impress me at all.

Am returning the Alexa studio. cannot understand why a restart program is not a crucial part of this device when wi fi signal is weak or lost.,1,-0.7952,Negative,101
364,"I bought the Echo Studio in early April along with a FireTV Cube so that I could have easy voice control over my TV, and good quality sound without spending an arm and leg on the sound quality (like with Bose, Sonos, or other highly rated soundbars with Alexa integrated). Setup was very easy as with other Echo products. But setup and pairing with the FireTV cube was a bit more complex and confusing - took a good 5 minutes. The Studio speaker is not listed in the FireTV soundbar options, only a generic Amazon soundbar. So I was concerned whether everything would work correctly. For the first few days, everything worked beautifully, just as I had expected.

After using it for a few days with the FireTV, Cube we noticed that the audio would just cut out for a couple seconds in the middle of someone saying something on a show. Had to rewind so you could understand what was going on. It didn't seem to matter whether the show was on HBO Now, Netflix, or Amazon Prime. Very annoying. The frequency and amount of time the sound would cut out got worse the longer we used the speaker. To solve the problem, I had to reset the speaker and re-pair it with the Cube - not something you want to deal with in the middle of a show.

I put up with this for another week or so, as it seemed to work OK for several days at time. Then when I was trying to reset/re-pair with the Cube, the speaker would say ""Sorry, the internet is not available right now"". That wasn't true because the Cube was connected over the same Wi-Fi router in the same room. For some reason, it would not recognize my Wi-Fi router. The only way to fix this was to unplug the speaker and start all over again. This happened a couple more times so I gave up and decided to return the speaker. FireTV Cube works great, but not with the Studio speaker. I'm going to break down and spend the extra cash on a Sonos soundbar.",3,0.7826,Positive,356
365,"It's bigger than I thought. The bass and treble, well it hits high highs and low lows, but the mid range is rather muddy. I imagine they can fix that with software after feedback encourages them. 3D sound is cool, but there is little content at this juncture. Only had it a day and my neighbors know I have it.
It is by far the best sound device in the Echo series.
I initially gave this 5 stars. Came back to give it 4 stars then while writing the part of the review below I changed it to three stars.
After using it a bit the sound levels are so inconsistent that the unit requires constant attention. Played songs by Maurice Ravel. It started with Bolero. I didn't hear anything until finally I heard the faint whispers of the song. So I said next song. Impressions de France came up loud and clear.
This happened with multiple other songs. One song played, I adjusted the volume. The next song came on either a great deal louder or lower. This has happened several times.
Update 10/28/2020
Changed my review to 2 stars. My Echo dot in the bathroom, on the other side of the apartment understands me. But neither Echo Studio understands me that well. It is so inconsistent as a speaker system and voice control. Frustrating...",2,0.9794,Positive,226
366,"Cannot stereo pair with any older devices, completely useless for stereo sound. There is a mono device. No amount of technology in the Studio is going to overcome its poor mono sound compared to stereo. Amazon, your speaker engineers need to have their ears checked and their degrees questioned. Returning device for some other schmuck to buy refurbished.",1,-0.796,Negative,58
367,"I bought 2 of these for the best sound and for the Atmos effects. Sound quality is really good, Atmos effect, so so. You can't be sitting anymore than 6 or 7 feet away from the speakers to get the full benefit of the Atmos effect. Bass is good and dialogue is good as well. I bought a fire TV cube in order to pair them as a home theater setup.

What's annoying is that when you sit down to watch something, the sound doesn't always come up. You have to keep switching the program on and off until the sound finally comes through. Also, you can be watching a program and either 1 or both speakers will cut out for no reason at all (extremely annoying). It got so bad I finally replaced them with a sound bar with wireless subwoofer and rear speakers. A bit costly but MUCH better than having the sound turn off for no reason at all.

I'd say this is a great concept but not really ready for prime time yet. I would have to say out of all the Echo products I've purchased, these were a big disappointment.",2,0.1936,Positive,195

I’ve got six echo dots, 2 echo 2nd gen, 3 echo 3rd gen, 1 echo plus, a few echo inputs and an echo show in every room. I love all of them except this one. It is a huge disappointment.

Update. A week or so after my review Amazon called and was able to walk me threw something that helped the volume problem.

Tonight I moved the Studio to my Den and set up a Home Theater with my Fire TV 4K. OK, what a difference in the sound. I previously had an old Bose 5 speaker and bass home theater set up to my tv. There is no comparison to the sound I am getting with the Echo Studio. I can feel the bass and the sound is so clear. No more need for close captioning to read what didn’t come through clear enough on the Bose. I am so impressed. I will for sure be getting another Echo Studio to pair with it. Can’t imagine what that will sound like.",5,0.5534,Positive,195
369,"Okay, so where do i begin?

If you like jazz, great speaker. Play some John Coltrane and it wafts through the speakers and tickles your ears. Diana Washington's September in the Rain is a great song on Amazon Music HD to test it.

If you like rock, well you will be slightly disappointed. i found that bass was ok, but midrange was lacking on many songs. That Smell by Lynyrd Skynyd is plain and faceless. Rolling Stones songs were meh.

Modern pop rock is ok, and that doesn't take a lot to reproduce.

Overall, I give it a 3 of 5. Alexa misses hearing me 1/3 or the time or miscommunicates when it does. Not so with my Alexa Dot, which is spot on everytime.

This is kinda like the story of the 3 bears, no one will be happy but can you live with the bed you laid in, perhaps, but for the price? Maybe not.

I have a few echos throughout the house, from the plus to the show and the latest one is the Echo Studio. I’ve had the worst time with music streaming. I’ve upgraded to all the premium memberships. HD, family plan, unlimited we’re purchased because echos weren’t playing music in different rooms with the membership I had before. So I upgrade to the best so I can enjoy and it’s been so glitchy and totally not HD sounding. I’ve compared the same songs on amazon and Apple Music and Apple Music has the incredible clarity and rich defined sounds on several songs. Apple Music doesn’t even advertise “ultra hd” or whatever and their music is SOOOO much better.

Unfortunately I’ve purchased so many echoes and smart home items that I will not return them all like I did last year. This time around I’m having a horrible problem where my echoes play explicit songs bleeped! What actual f word????? AMAZON, really???? I have called tech support several times and they’ve guided to turn off the filter (not like I hadn’t done that a million times before) such a turn off, amazon! We pay extra for HD and sounds sub par, tired in several speakers and Apple Music sounds way better. And another thing is the false advertising. I’ve had several songs clearly indicating explicit and then the words are bleeped. I can’t 😔",2,0.9768,Positive,236
371,"Simply put, not worth the price.

The speaker lacks consistent volume output. A device this expensive should have an internal volume stabilizer so all music plays at the actual volume you select.

As for the sound, look it's only going to be as good as what it receives and if you're going to be listening to music from the Amazon music playlist, you will really be disappointed. Little care goes into actually matching the mood or category you select and even then this speaker lacks clarity and definition, let alone adequate bass without pushing it.

True, the Studio has its own HUB and that's a plus, but, so too, does the Echo.

All in all. It's an average sound and does not give good base unless played at a level greater than, I suspect, most people care to listen to.

It sounds better than sound bars, but not quite as good as a Dolby Atmos home theater system with components, unless you pair 2 of the Studios with an Echo Sub. That's where the really good stuff happens. But, for just a single unit, it pumps out some really nice sound with plenty of bass, but not overpowering or muddy. It sounds very tight and accurate. Compared to the Apple Homepod, it's not quite as accurate and clear, but it's close, and the Studio gets quite a bit louder. The Studio also has a built-in hub for Hue lights and other devices.

I asked Alexa what it was playing and it said that ""No music was being played"". It never did this until I got this device. So there is some issue that is keeping me from using this device as it should work. It does process faster than the smaller Alexa devices.

If you want to impress someone with your audiophile knowledge and say the highs or lows or middles are not to your liking, feel free.

The Apple HomePod is definitely higher fidelity, but the HomePod is a one trick pony in my opinion and there are a few other disappointing elements of the HomePod. The Echo Studio is all around the better “smart” speaker especially if you already have echo or Alexa infrastructure in your house. The sound is fairly solid; after some EQ in the app you can get it to perform. I think the sound has a better gelling compression as well so songs sound more stereo. There is a 3D mode that works on Amazon music that adds enough separation and sparkle to sound more like a HomePod if you really like a lot of clarity in your home audio. I saved this for last, I was a sound engineer for over a decade and I think both speakers are pretty good for a single speaker that auto adjusts to your environment. You’ll be pretty happy to save the space and have the assistant with either. In the end I go with Echo studio because it can connect to Bluetooth which allows me to stream anything I want to it.

Also drops bluetooth a lot and doesn't remember previous devices. Hard to play Spotify, constantly disconnects and switches to another device. Boots me and defaults to the PC a lot.

Sound quality is decent for what it is but I still prefer the top 2 JBL models for that. Plus they're portable... But really, if I want high fidelity I'll throw on a record or pop in an SACD disc. Takes a lot to impress me in this department and a $200 product ain't gonna hack it.

383,"I have plenty of Echos in my house. I really didn’t need another one but I was looking for something to give me more bass when I play music through the whole house. I’ve tried placing this on a shelf, in an entertainment center and even just sitting on the floor. None of these places gave me the bass I was hoping for. Don’t get me wrong, this is an amazing echo device. The sound quality from the other speakers in this is great. If you were to pair this with another Studio I’m sure it’d sound amazing. My problem is, for the price, this is not worth it.",4,0.9712,Positive,109
384,Welcome audio files May poo poo this unit I think it is fantastic for its ability to provide instant music on demand with a high quality of resolution. It may not be the best but it certainly in the ballpark for competition with Sonos Bose and the rest. I already had Alexa and various places the voice recognition was pretty good this one's even better. And I might add that the base is admirable as well. Lots of pretty good quality sound and functional capabilities with this unit. You might even buy another one for a bit more stereo sound.,5,0.9876,Positive,100
385,"As a sound designer, I spend a lot of time in front of high -end studio monitors. Can echo studio match them? Of course not, but then again, that is not the point (besides being economically impossible). The point is accurate reproduction of a mix, and this device does the job in a very pleasant and unassuming way. With six inch woofer and smartly positioned tweeters, it almost manages to create a stereo image while covering a full spectrum of frequency response. I would expect that paired with another echo studio it could sound better (and more accurate) than many low end, smaller studio monitors, and certainly better than “multimedia” monitors like Mackie CR series etc. The reason for this, besides pretty smart and good engineering, is a built in “room correction” that measures frequency response of your room and adapts echo’s output accordingly. In professional audio, we pay a lot of money for this kind of calibration, and here you get it as if it were nothing. All in all, for the price, this product is pretty amazing.",5,0.9925,Positive,179
386,"So far there is nothing to dislike about the Amazon Echo Studio. I have an Amazon Echo and have been happy with its performance since I purchased it several years ago. However the sound quality and sometimes the voice recognition was not the best. It was located in a large open area that includes a large kitchen and living area. The Amazon Echo Studio now occupies that space and eradicates the issues I had with the smaller Amazon echo. Voice recognition is exceptional. I can in a normal tone and volume instruct the Amazon Studio from another room and always get the correct response. And the sound is extraordinary for a single speaker unit. I do not have the time to listen to a lot of music, but when I do the sounds from the Echo Studio are excellent. Aesthetically the unit fits the décor of my living area perfectly. The Echo Studio flawlessly connected to all my in house devices and makes life much easier for me. Very happy with the unit.",5,0.9813,Positive,173

Now, if I didn't have these expectations I likely would be satisfied.

 I bought these after reading about the Alexa Home theater (search youtube) using these and a fire tv cube. From the standpoint of just being single speakers they sound decent. However, I dont believe decent enough to be worth their price point. I got two of them and have them paired to have 3d mode and have Dolby atmos. The 3d music is cool but can only be done with a handful of amazon tracks. The Atmos for movies and tv is okay (not amazing) and again it only works with certain media through certain apps. Otherwise they are connected speakers. I had a couple of bookshelf speakers attached before that I think did just as well. Getting the home theater through Alexa setup was a chore. I work in tech and have done home theater for a while and I gave up. My wife ended up figuring out after re-doing it countless times. I also wish I could get audio input through something other than wifi. When we swich inputs on our tv we have no connected audio (more a fire tv issue) but worth noting.

They are nice because everything is connected through alexa, but for a premium speaker they aren't amazing and the setup was just Alright. That song above is recorded through my iphone 12 (mini) and that is one of Amazon's HD tracks. (for reference).

The sound quality exceeded my expectations.
While not stereo, the spatial feature made it sound like it was.
I played a trick on wifey: Had some Xmas music playing loud as she walked in the front door.
She immediately went to the home stereo to turn the volume down, but saw it was off.
Had a confused look on her face, as she walked around the living room trying to figure out where the music was coming from.
When she realized it was coming from this unit on the sofa tabletop behind the lamp, she could not believe it !",5,-0.2942,Negative,121
395,It's pretty much what you would expect for audio features and it acts like an Echo. Enough said. What isn't as apparent is just how huge this thing is. I bought it as an audio upgrade for and Echo that is on an end table conveniently and unobtrusively tucked behind a lamp. I figured this model was similar in profile.... It is NOT. It is about 4x as large as a full size echo or about the size of a bucket. If you are planning on putting this on a table or counter it will NOT be inconspicuous. Mine is probably going on the floor in the corner of the room or under an end table. I probably shouldn't ding it for size but really it was a surprise and honestly the audio quality isn't that much better than a much smaller Echo Plus which I thought this was the next evolution of. I do not have buyers remorse but I can't use it as intended.,4,0.7999,Positive,166
396,We have had this for like 4 months its amazing sound... But for some reason I needed a extra cord that doesnt come with it to hook it up to our brandnew 4k tv shame on Amazon then on top of that... The sound dissapears all the time forcing me to get up from my seat... Unplug it and plug it back in very frustrating having to to do this several times a week if not more... It was alot of money for it to come without the ability to hookup via blutooth or at least come with the damh cord u need to hook it up to the tv the reason why I gave it as many stars is the sound is better than anything u can buy out there its amazing sound I may buy a second one just for that movie theater feel ... Even tho u need a cord for it. Amazon please fix this ... I guess u dont need a cord if have a fire tv ... Didnt know that,5,0.7556,Positive,176
397,"I got carried away during the “Amazon day” sale and bought two more echo studios thinking I could do a three way pairing with the one I already have. Nope, you can only pair two into a stereo thing us. Which sounds fine and all. I think what I really wanted was to add in a thumps bass. A real bass with a big ol’ speaker. Way bigger than in the studio.

Over all, these echo studios are performing as expected and I expect a lot. I’ve been using various echo units for years and have been migrating toward more of the more capable ones. Seems reasonable because the things keep getting upgrades and more capabilities. Meanwhile, I use them for more stuff. A virtuous cycle.

398,"It's a nice speaker, but as a
replacement for my Bose sound bar, uh, not, not the greatest sound. But the Bose shuts off after 30 minutes and you need to really point the controller in the right way to start it up again, so the Bose got exiled into my office. But the Bose had much better sound. I expected more from the Studio, but it is nice and much better than the Echo, which sits sadly on the kitchen counter.

I had to call customer support to get it up and running.

I like the fact that the Studio permits me to include it in multi-room audio as well as use it as a ""Home Theater"" (which it is not). Anyway, it is way better than the Echo and serves for TV sound output, but I don't get the nice stereo sound of jets flying across the living room as one would wish. I am considering adding a second Studio to connect in stereo, but that could end in divorce.

Does anyone have experience using 2 Studios for stereo? Is it worth it or is it better to get a good sound bar?
Update: I bought a second studio and then after many months that the bass sub was not available, bought one of those. With all 3 working together I am a happy camper, the sound is rich and fills the room very nicely. I am raising to 5 stars.",5,0.9945,Positive,243

Let the music play too long and then hit pause, 50% of the time this requires you swipe the app off and restart it. Certainly not fun but the worst? Alexa will make beeping noises every afternoon when left plugged in and despite having voice control off. Nothing super long or loud but just a beep or two and if it happens once it will happen at least 3 times in the afternoon. Very annoying especially since we have it set up in an office. I had decided to replace tonight with something else but of course, today no beeps or required restarts making me second guess spending the money for a replacement speaker.",3,-0.9466,Negative,151

The build is really good but the weight in it is really heavy. Don’t understand for what though. Lastly and the most important for me at least. Is the connectivity, it states is Bluetooth compatible but it is not , unless it is connected with WiFi. If you’re not connected on WiFi it is a useless speaker which will not work on anything.

404,"This is replacing a 1st gen Echo in a very large room. The sound quality is much better and it does OK for a huge room where the original Echo was weak and tinny. Unfortunately it is really buggy. It becomes unresponsive and needs to by unplugged and plugged back in at least once every 2 days. Also the volume is really inconsistent. Sometimes Alexa is whispering, and each response can have very different volumes. For example when asking Alexa questions she might answer in her current volume, but if instead she reads something from the news or from Wikipedia the volume may be much louder. Depending on the station music might be either very faint or very loud compared to Alexa's responses.

Overall it is probably worth the Prime day 2020 price of $150 but could be much better. The problems do seem to be software related though so hopefully it will get better in the future, although the Studio has already been out a year.",3,0.9301,Positive,167

After restarting and restoring all my devices 3 times I was finally able to sync them. I watched some Amazon prime content and I was very disappointed. The sound was not as crisp as I wanted and it felt it needed a center speaker. I bought this in hopes of replacing a sound bar but my old Definitive Audio sound bar blew these away.

I plugged in the Echo Studio and it immediately went through the boot-up and set-up process. Within a minute of it talking to my iPhone's Alexa app, it was on my secured home wifi network. It did a system upgrade quietly and rebooted itself... after that, setup was done.

Man oh man this thing sounds phenomenal! For ""one"" speaker (with a bunch of tiny speakers inside) - its spatial stereo sound is nearly jaw-dropping. I had Alexa play me some of their ""3D Music"" - and you can tell it's been specifically mastered for a speaker like the Echo Studio.

You can fine-tune the speaker with a three band EQ within the app as well.

Did anyone know that you can ask your Echo what the Net Worth of most celebrities is, and get an answer, or how tall they are, or what year they where born, and usually get an answer. My new Echo Studio has its own electronics Hub built in to it, and it has much better speakers, more of them, and in a configuration that provides a board listening stage, with much more accuracy, and real bass too.

Amazon's 3D enabled music selections seem more raucous and 'contemporary' but still the listening experience is excellent there as well. My one negative, and this has nothing to do with the Echo Studio speaker, Amazon's music frequently doesn't play through the entire music selection and skips mid-song to another selection.

I wish it had better hearing from any distance, as I feel that I need to be within about 15 feet for it to respond to a request.

My wife got me the Studio for Christmas because I wanted to use it in home as the central Sound system for the main area of the house as we have an open floor plan. This one speaker fills our whole upstairs with plenty of sound for us. The problem is that when I went to bluetooth it to my new Samsung Qled TV it pairs just fine but will not play the audio from my TV. I tried for hours to trouble shoot the problem unpairing and re-pairing, changing audio stream formats, even factory resets a couple times but nothing.
We own Echo Dot(s), Echo Plus, Echo, Echo Tap, 2 4K Fire Sticks, and Fire Tv Cube. As a test, I paired one of our Echo Dots and the Echo Tap to this TV and it worked just fine.
So I gave up and called support. They informed me that this flagship $200.00 Echo Studio Speaker cannot be paired to a TV without the use of an Amazon Fire Stick/Fire Cube. That is just crazy to me. Why can I pair my $29.99 Echo Dot to my TV (Which no one would do) but not this $200 speaker? It took me literally half a day to reconfigure the devices around my house to get the Fire Cube into my living room and set up with the Studio. There is no reason for this, it says right on the box that it supports DOLBY ATMOS, so why do I need to pair it to a Fire product???

Anyways, I just wanted to write this review for anyone looking at this speaker to do what we are using it for and does not feel like dealing with the headache. If I did not already own a Fire Cube and I was not able to rearrange my setup to keep everything working pretty much the same at the end of the day I would have returned it and gave it a 2 star.

Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…

I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.
• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.
• Unable to save favorite stations
• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.
• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.
• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms.
I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker. I wanted to provide this information for anyone who is on the fence like I was….",3,0.9989,Positive,700
424,"Installed a fire stick on a smart TV specifically to mate to the studio for sound. Every minute or so the sound drops for a second, really ruins watching a movie. Thought it was the connection to the TV so I disabled the TV link. Now when it plays music it has the same issue with dropping out for a second every minute or two.
Also when TV was connecyed only had sound for fire stick apps not for anything broadcast through cable.",1,-0.5095,Negative,83
425,"I bought the Echo Studio to connect to my 43” Insignia Fire TV but the only way I can get it to work is via Bluetooth. Bluetooth works fine for music, but for regular tv programs I have a terrible lip sync problem that I have been unable to solve. Others have the same problem. The only solution might be to connect a separate fire stick to the TV so that I can get audio via WiFi, not Bluetooth. The Studio works fine, but not as a speaker for Indignia Fire TV. It looks like Amazon is not supporting the Fire Tv app built into a smart Insignia Fire TV.",2,-0.751,Negative,110
426,"Purchased this so I could pair this with my Fire TV 4K. The audio cuts out for a second or two every few minutes. I contacted support which they had factory reset it, but the same issues exists. After researching online, I see a lot of customers have this issue. I don't know if this is a hardware issue or a software problem, but it's a problem. I don't think it is a hardware problem since streaming music works flawlessly. When I have the Fire TV 4K play audio from the TV speakers, there is no audio cut out.",2,-0.888,Negative,99
427,"Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:

Sound Quality:

While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.

Alexa:
While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.

Size:

This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.

Room adaptation:

This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.

3D MUSIC:

This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.

Built in Zigbee:

I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.

Competition:

For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.

Using it as a sound bar:

I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.

Summary:

I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.",5,0.9975,Positive,613
428,"OMG I’m beyond impressed!! This thing had superseded my expectations and then some! Watching movies on the 4K Fire TV stick is something else! You can hear every single sound, note & melody flying all around your head and let’s not forget the bass! It is clean and does not distort! Each time it pounds your chest pounds with it! Also amazon music HD unlimited is amazing with the speaker! HD, Super HD & 3D HD music blows my mind away! I will be purchasing another one soon! I was so impressed I purchased the Echo Sub to pair with it, that will be delivered tomorrow! My room is going to be bumping and slapping so hard! All while crystal clear! Mind boggling!!",5,0.9695,Positive,123
429,"WARNING. Do not buy the Echo Studio if you want to hook up other echo devices to it thinking you can create a surround sound system. The Echo Studio IS NOT compatible with two Echo Dots. I was told by my local Best Buy that if you have a Fire Stick, you can create a home theater with the Echo Studio + (2) Echo Dots. This will not work. Unless someone can assist me on figuring it out, it is not possible. This was very disappointing.",3,-0.0839,Negative,86
430,"I purchased two of these to compliment my FireTV 4k setup and 85"" LG 4k TV. Well, the sound is just okay and the whole 3D sound/home theatre concept is not apparent to me whatsoever. I am no audiophile, but as a layperson I am unimpressed for the $400 investment. With that said, my actual complaint is that it is a CONSTANT in and out connection with the FireTV...near constant crackle, repeat noises and missing sounds. I have to unplug it, and wait for it to reconnect and then have to deal with the voice/sound being off. Frankly, I am disappointed. I expected it to work flawlessly with another Amazon product...it does not. Also, note that the speakers flank the TV so it's not a ""too far from the FireTV"" issue. It's become so annoying that will most likely replace them. Think long and hard if you plan to use it as a home theatre system. You've been warned!",2,-0.9471,Negative,159
431,"Let me start by saying the sound quality of the studio is fantastic. The design is clean. Now the bad, this studio simply put, has terrible microphones. I have changed locations multiple times, reset the system and still only recognizes about half the time. Even in a very quiet setting.
I own the original echo and let me say while the sound quality is seriously lacking when compared to the studio, the voice recognition is far superior. Let's face it, how good is a system if it fails to acknowledge you and play the music you asked for. It's pretty bad that I had to pair my sonos to my Gen one Alexa to get good sound as my studio is more or less useless. I expect more for $200. Amazon and Alexa let me down. Loyal customers deserve better.. My next smart speaker will be a sonos.",2,0.9412,Positive,148
432,"I wanted to use this instead of a sound bar and it has worked out great! We were watching a show we always watched and my wife said, where is that music coming from. It was from the show, we had just never heard it before because it was so low. Thinking about adding another to group.
UPDATE:
I loved this, when it works, but it constantly drops bluetooth. Tried to wire it to the TV, but you can't user the remote for volume. IF Amazon had an audio out on the Fire TV Cube, it would work I assume. Instead of arguing with the wife over, ""wait a minute, let me unpair and pair it AGAIN so we can watch TV""..., I just unplug it. It is now just sitting by the Fire TV Cube....paperweight.. Might be good for listening to music, but not for what I bought it for.",2,-0.3533,Negative,151
433,"Great addition as assistant for your home. When on your network it can help with answers to thousands of questions. The unit fits into your life anywhere. I put it at a central area so you can hear music on the ground level and the first floor. Sound from music is very impressive; for the size of the unit. We have an echo dot in the living room to eliminate shouting at the studio. The echo dot & the studio are synced as one, if you start a timer on the studio and you’re in the living room the dot will tell you the remaining time. Also, either unit can do other tasks in independently. The studio has better sound; it’s also more expensive. I would purchase the studio again, yes, it’s expensive, I’m more interested in good sound. For me it was the right purchase.",5,0.9688,Positive,146
434,"I'm updating my review again. I tried two regular Fire Sticks and neither worked without distortion. Went through a few optical cables and that didn't work. I ended up buying a 4K Fire Stick and an Ethernet adapter. The audio hasn't dropped or distorted yet, so switching to the 4K seems to have solved that problem. I still can't get the Fire Stick remote to control the Studio, but that's a different issue. No audio distortion is a win. The issue now is that the sound gets out of sync. I have to disconnect the Fire Stick and Studio and reconnect them in the Alexa app to fix it. The sound is good when it works, but it's been a weeks long, fiddly process to get the thing to work. And only sometimes at that. I definitely regret the purchase of the Studio. I'd return it if I could.",2,0.5341,Positive,149
435,"Pros: decent sound if you have a multi echo system and are using it for music only
Cons: it's massive
Not loud enough to use for a fire TV system
Not nearly loud enough for TV shows
3d music is still ... Strange",3,-0.4939,Negative,43
436,"We added the Echo Studio to our home network of Echo devices as the main device on the main floor of our townhouse. We have three other devices of different sizes on two other floors of our home. The sound quality of the Echo Studio is by far superior to even the most current version of the Echo towers and, when linked to the other devices and played all together, our house literally sings.

The Echo Studio calibrates itself to the room it is in and the resulting sound quality is immersive and does justice to our wide range of musical tastes. We initially tested the sound on classic rock, dance, orchestral, choral, country, and pop. We play music and audiobooks on our devices daily and love how this device enhances our overall listening experience.

The one feature we miss on this device versus the towers is the ability to check the temperature in the room it sets in. But that’s it.

Love it. Would buy another one. Looking forward to the next upgrade.",5,0.9393,Positive,174
437,"When I first saw and read everything I could find about the Echo Studio speakers I thought they would be a game changer. Well, I still like them very much but with a very disappointing discovery. After setting up 7 Studio stereo sub pairs, 1 pair of stereo Dot speakers, and a Netgear mesh range extender (total of 23 Echo device's) THEY WILL NOT ALL PLAY THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME. That's the reason I bought them in the first place. Customer service techs have told me Amazon has a limit of 10 devises'. SUPRISE SUPRISE. Now I'm angry that I have to adide buy a seemingly arbitrary Amazon decision. I always try to be a positive person but from now on I will always resent Amazon's arbitrary decision to limit the number of device's that can be connected to 1 account. IS THERE ANY SOLUTION TO THIS SITUATION?",4,0.0496,Neutral,151
438,"I purchased two studios and an echo sub because my smart household is.l basically ran by Amazon. I really enjoy watching movies and TV but also listen to a lot of music and am pretty picky about good sound. I can safely say that I firmly believe this $500 combo (purchased on Black Friday) is likely better than most setups you could purchase with the same amount of money. I have never listened to the Homepod but I have listened to the Sonos One. Yes the Sonos One and Homepod both likely sound better than the Studio if you are critically listening. However, I do know that the difference is not so significant that I regret my purchase. It was a little difficult to set up the speakers to my fire stick 4k at first because it was my first time doing it. For some reason the speakers would show as unavailable and I didn't understand why. I contacted Amazon support and they helped me troubleshoot the issue and I had it up and running in less than 10 minutes. Movie sounds quality is night and day compared to the speaker on my TV. The experience has been seamless since they've been set up. The only thing that disappointed me was how little of a selection there is as far as Dolby Atmos streaming because as of right now Amazon only supports Atmos on prime video titles. I wish you could take advantage of Atmos on Netflix and other streaming services but hopefully with time they will work something out as far as that goes. Movies still sound amazing but that would've been nice to have seeing as the main selling point is their ""3D sound"". Overall these speakers in a 2.1 setup with the echo sub sound amazing and provide an excellent value for the money and I would highly recommend it. Totally worth it if you have Amazon Music HD.",5,0.9965,Positive,322
439,"We use this as our main source of music. As to immersive sound quality, it’s fantastic, but We had to adjust it’s height to find where that perfect spot was. My husband is an audiophile, and he is quite satisfied with Echo Studio’s sound quality.

The challenge has been with Alexa. My husband was ready to send it back until we found that the best way to select music is from our iPhones. It was maddening when we would ask for a particular album cut. It seemed Alexa could usually find the album, but if we asked for a stand-alone song from the album, she couldn’t find it.

I do love that she can create playlists or that you can be awakened with the songs of your choice instead of an alarm. I’m much more energized that way.",5,0.9804,Positive,138
440,"This was a bit of a letdown. I was excited to get it but it just doesn't provide the boom I expected.

Voice activation of Alexa doesn't work from a distance while the system is at a high volume. I bought this thing to only work at high volumes so it sucks that Alexa doesn't wake up when I need it most.

Another issue is it's ability (or inability) to connect to other Alexa devices. When connected it to the fire tv it would sound great but would constantly disconnect or reconnect with no sound. Sadly, it's just inconsistent.

Lastly, the sound isn't that great. Compared to most soundbars, its a great competitor, but if you have a decent (5.1) sound system it doesn't compare.

If you have a recent generation Echo and a good sound system, just connect your Echo to the system with an aux cord (with male connectors on both sides). You won't regret it.

You can connect your fire tv to it and get surrounded sound without connecting directly to the TV.

Alexa voice wakes up from anywhere in a 20×20 room.

The Good things... I love this device. The sound is very good. I'm not going to blow smoke up your skirt, it's not a High Fidelity (HiFi) device, it's a well designed Amazon Echo with good speakers, great voice recognition, and sounds very good. Anyone who tells you that you can get High Fidelity out of a small device it lying to you. Be cautious when someone says the sound is outstanding when the device is smaller than a hair dryer. Use some common sense and understand what you are buying. If you are an audiophile then this is not your product because you will analyze everything that is not a flat response. But if you are just looking to listen to some reasonably good sounding music at a low to medium high volume level, this is your device.",5,0.9233,Positive,152

The sound quality really is a big improvement over other Alexa equipment. However, for the price, I would like to see a bit better sound.

Why I don’t love it, well I purchased the set specifically as a home theatre system. When it works, the sound is incredible. Unfortunately it disconnects from my 4K firetv constantly. Just about everyday, half way through the movie. So I’m left having to stop it and restart it so it reconnects. I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve umpaired my 4K firetv from the speakers because it was so annoying.",3,0.6683,Positive,98
445,"I have echo and echo dot in the house. The studio was a replacement for the dot in my bedroom, and frankly I’m very disappointed with the studio sound/bass. Studio is pla mid-room, on a dresser, 3D is turned off, and bass in Alexa app is set at highest setting. I run it about volume 4 or 5, not ‘party’ loud. It doesn’t really sound better (bass) than the dot! I should return it, but I’ve tried living with it for a week and its now used. Hate to see it go to land-fill. For comparison, I have a Marshall stanmore blue tooth speaker in my garage, admittedly costs $100 more but it has same size speakers and it’s awesome - I suspect the amp is a lot better.... I also have a Bose ‘sound Link color’ $99 for my kitchen TV, its more compact and sounds better than the studio. I wished I would have shopped a bit more and compared to Sonos, but online the Studio ratings were good and I was looking for the seamless Alexa experience of an amazon device, which I got, but the sound, base in particular, doesn’t cut it...",3,0.8731,Positive,196

The 1st thing I tested and LOVED was that even with music at full volume, it still hears you. Our original echo could not hear you when the music is at full blast and you'd have to bust out the phone and use the app to get it to stop or push the button. 2nd, the music quality is GREAT. Studio quality, no, but love it and the bass is impressive for such a small unit. We originally were going to order an eco sub to sync to it but after hearing it, the sub is not needed.

We connected ours to a Firestick 4k and the general functionality was pretty cool, although setup was more complicated than it should have been. Audio for shows on various platforms (Prime, Hulu, Netflix) cut out constantly, to the point that we were continuously having to rewind to see what we missed. In addition to the cutting out, there were multiple times that the sound would stop all together.

Amazon support was eager to help. We spent over an hour trouble shooting but unfortunately nothing seemed to do the trick. Ended up returning the speaker all together after ~10 days. Might be worth looking at again if there is a software update or perhaps version 2.",2,0.5927,Positive,160

The highs are crisp and clear, the lows are clean and powerful- I can feel them in my chest at 50% volume. Alexa is responsive, but you'll have to scream her name if the volume is up over 70%. I will be buying more of these puppies starting with a stereo pair. Full disclosure, I sprang for the Amazon music HD music subscription. I agree with other reviewers on the form factor.

When I am finished and go back to it I have no sound. The only way for me to get sound, is to reset both devices, unpair my “home theatre” group and do it all over again as a brand new unit.

I love the full sound of the Echo studio. I have an Echo subwoofer on order and am looking forward to pairing the two together. I have a set of Klipsch audio speakers for my computer that sits on the same desk, and I've considered replacing them with the Echo Studio plus subwoofer.

My wife and I use Alexa for everything from reminders to alarms and timers, shopping lists and home automation (lights, furnace, A/C, etc) and I would have to say I'm 90% pleased with the system. Any disappointment I have would be related to the fact that there are times I have to repeat myself when giving Alexa a command. I honestly haven't had time to investigate whether this is room placement or Alexa itself.

This round of Echo devices has been epic! I can't wait to try some of the others, such as the Echo show with the screen that follows the subject to the security drone that's been promised for the near future.

I suppose I am just going to have to wait until Amazon comes up with a 3 foot tall Echo floor speaker. Or if other companies would finally get their head out of their @sses and come up with something similar to that WITH Echo MRM capability. Amazon opened the door to that a while back, but surprisingly no one has really jumped on it!

The BT is excellent for music, but not very good for video meetings.",4,0.9247,Positive,91
453,"The Echo Studio is way louder than all the other echoes with superb vocals, which reproduce clearly but with room for improvements.

The good:
The product itself is impressive. As an audiophile, I love the way this smart speaker sounds. It has the right balance of bass with excellent mid-tones and trebles out of the box.

Volume: As I mentioned before, it is loud enough to feel the music or to throw a party. I can see that pairing two of them will create enough volume for a large room when positioned correctly.

Streaming: I can pair my SiriusXM and Spotify with no problem. Apple Music tested and no issues either. It’ll play music according to where it is available. For example, if I ask for a popular song, Amazon Music will probably have it, but when it comes to specific songs, Spotify will be your streaming service.

The bad:
Streaming Volumes: The music will play alright, but having different streaming services will mean that each of them has a different volume output. I find Spotify louder that SiriusXM. So adjusting the volume sometimes does bother me. I would like the Echo to analyze the volume input for every service and then output it at the same standard volume and even amplify it so that it can sound equal to the others.

Voice recognition: Even though this speaker has more microphones around, I still experience problems when calling Alexa to turn on and off the lights. I have to raise my voice, even though my room is small. But don’t let this bring you down, it could be that I’m not clear enough. I sometimes speak fast.

Sometimes calling for a specific song in Spotify from X artist will not work; it’ll instead play the This is X artist on Spotify.

The vocals are reproduced easily on this speaker. However, I find it 4/5 on vocal reproduction. The vocals sound like if they were in the middle of the stage and not out in the front.

I don't care to shout at my Alexa. Second, the sound is better but not $200's worth. Third, it integrated with the Fire Cube (which is also going back) and did almost nothing without repeated commands, I don't want to shout at my TV either. Four, one cannot see the lights and that's just dumb design. This is my fourth Echo, and I thought I was stepping up to replace my big ole first generation, but I am truly sorry I tried. I do not recommend and figure we need to wait for another generation or two, especially one with a proper design. I gave it a generous three stars, but I think it's a bad item, not yet ready for consumers who are familiar with Alexa and use it a lot.",3,-0.9106,Negative,165
457,"I got two of these to be a 2.1 home theater setup. I already have a really nice, studio quality down firing 12"" sub so I wanted to use a 3rd generation dot to add that into a home theater setup with the fireTV and the two echo studios. Sounds reasonable, right? No can do. Yes, you could create such a configuration if you buy Amazon's tiny 6"" sub and you could use a dot to add your own sub to one echo studio but in its infinite wisdom, Amazon must have added software that only recognizes its own sub in a 2.1 home theater setup. Hopefully some day in the future Amazon will allow a dot to be used in the configuration... or multiple dots if you wanted to add rear effect amplified speakers that were not from the Amazon echo family by using the dot as a pairing connection for non-Amazon speakers. But for now, if you want a sub in a home theater configuration, you're stuck with an Amazon only setup. That said, the echo studios do work great in a home theater config and I will be replacing my Sony/Bose 5.1 system with these... also makes the wife very happy... look dear, no wires ;-)",4,0.9798,Positive,209
458,"I had been looking for a sound bar for my television and saw that this compared closely in price to many of the higher end sound bars I was researching. The quality of the treble and bass are excellent for the size of the speaker and the separation is vastly better than a sound bar. I made the right choice. Also, the 3D and HD music quality from Amazon Music is noticeable for those audiophiles out there.

Unfortunately, the sound was so good, I kept disconnecting it from the TV and taking it to other rooms. (Really upset the wife.) I now have two of these. The second is paired with a set of Echo Pluses and an Echo Sub. The quality of this combined set rivals the best stereo systems I have owned.",5,0.899,Positive,134
459,"This device gets loud so it therefore cannot hear its invocation word very well at times. Other than that I cannot think of another negative. I did try and use the Atmos effect form Amazon Music HD. It was not worth the price at the moment. It is only a $200 device but unless you have a $2000 plus receiver and true atmos speakers I do not recommend the Music HD Plan as a great upgrade with this device. Now on my surround sound system with 13 speakers 6 of which are Atmos the sound of the few soundtracks on atmos are quite amazing. Especially synched with my hue lights. Nice party, but that is a different review. I would recommend this product as a great stand alone device for outside or a relatively large room. It also works well with the Firestick or Amazon Firetv as a soundbar that can be utilized.",5,0.9862,Positive,153
460,"My echo sound worked fine in small areas, but in a larger room, it almost was tinny and bass sounds were lost. This new one has a way of adjusting itself to a larger space and now I was getting the full range of sound. I use it for classical music listening mostly so tinny is unacceptable. It definitely is not Dolby, but it is still good enough to be very enjoyable.. for such a small gadget. One word of caution, I get my music from Sirius XM and use that more than not and I had problems getting that loaded, which was not Alexa's fault. The problem was with Sirius that had inadvertently disconnected my streaming function..

So I called the support line and the lady wanted to hear it, so I held my phone up to Alexa and asked her a question and lo and behold she answered it, not it a super low voice and asking me to unlock my device. How do I unlock my device when I didn't lock it in the first place? Can someone tell me what's going on? ps I'm always nice to her, and I say thank you for the information.",1,0.6912,Positive,141

The sound is definitely better than TV speakers, which was my main purpose for purchasing them. If you have the 3D audio with prime music, the sound is awesome! You can really tell the difference. I really wanted to test that feature and I was not disappointed. I just hate that you have to pay extra to have that that feature, but I will keep paying for it anyway.
The thing I'm not too happy with is that I use AV cables to hook up my record player and the sound is not great that way, you can't enhance the sound or it will hum and sound quality diminishes. Also, I don't see any improvement with Alexa being able to hear me better. I still feel like I have to yell at her over the TV or music volume for her to pick up on my Voice.

When this first came out I laid the full price for it so my feelings are that of what a 200$ speaker should sound like and operate like and this ain’t it.

I already have an Alexa Theater set up and knew how wonderful it sounds (near as good as my Bose system), so along comes the Echo Studio.
Wow... It is awesome and I love it.
Sound quality is very impressive, bass response is definitely great, and the highs are as clear as a bell.
I highly recommend it for those who appreciate upper shelf sound quality.",5,0.9944,Positive,132
465,"This is a great product. My only small complaint is that the microphone for voice recognition seems to get lost when the speaker is at anything greater than 50% volume. You really have to start raising your voice for it to hear you. Also if you’re not facing it and you don’t speak a bit louder it won’t hear you at all. Now the major pronto thing is that the sound quality is rather great. Definitely closer to the Apple home pods sound quality. While it still falls a couple steps short companies to Apple home pod, for the price and Alexa capability it’s totally worth it. Much beefier bass amd much clearer and defined treble and mid ranges compared to echo 2nd generation and echo plus. Wish there was a way that as the sound volumes increases the listening mic would also increase so it can decipher your voice from the music better.",4,0.9583,Positive,154

I set it up for him (super fast and easy to set up) and played the first song. I was blown away by the beautiful sound quality! I used to lose only Bose products and when I compared the similarly-priced Bose with Alexa, the Studio SOUNDED BETTER! The bass was slightly better on the Bose (barely noticable) but the overall sound quality went to the Echo Studio. And it was cheaper! I played the same songs on both. The integration for the Bose was much more difficult than the Studio and there is a slight lag on the Bose (the Studio is quicker to respond to requests). Hope this helps!",5,0.9318,Positive,136

This week it has failed to respond at all until I just unplugged it again. It does sound amazing though with the companion sub! I will send it to the basement whenever a better unit comes out and I feel like dropping $$$ again. We had an original echo in this same location that never gave us trouble btw.,2,0.887,Positive,83

Dont get me wrong, I do find myself occasionally quietly listening with my eyes closed. This speaker sounds great, it just doesn't have the detail of a high fidelity system. No suprise there as it's a tenth of the price. I did notice underemphasized mids in some tracks such as Stevie Nick's Leather and Lace, but overall I still prefer the Studio over my Sonos One. I can't help but smile when listening to Pink Floyd or B.B. King. It's a fabulous speaker!",5,0.8081,Positive,110

For the first time I can tell the difference between a “good” sound reproduction and an excellent one(not all sound cuts are the same quality). I like being able to control volume by voice, iPad or easy access button on top. Also like the simple elegant lines.
All is very easy to setup with Alexa. My one complaint is that I like Apple Music because of library, but sometimes Alexa says Apple Music “not Available”. I will try again and it works.",5,0.9126,Positive,129

I really don't know how it does it and don't care. I bought one for my sister (who already has 5 echo's) and told her if she didn't like it she could just give it to me.

- sound quality is good but there is no substitution for a stereo pair unless you pay for AmazonMusic HD and have the speaker centered in front of you, didn’t work for me as it was blocking computer monitor or TV screen
- in the middle of playing random playlist the sound suddenly gets garbled while being loud! It’s unacceptable, thinking about returning the echo studio if the issue isn’t fixed in a month time
- Dolby atmos only supported with fire tv 4K stick, you can’t get it with AppleTV 4K. This feature seems to be useless for me.
- equalizer settings don’t seem to change anything, I can get more treble or less midrange

The only advice I would give is to put the speaker in your wish list or Cart, then ""save for later"". If you keep going back every couple of days, after a couple of weeks it just drops $40-$50 dollars - buy it right away as the price will go up again very quickly. This may be coincidental but I've had it happen on a couple of high priced items so I'll keep trying in future.
The ""3D sound"" I signed up for and the demo songs do sound slightly better but it's unnoticeable when playing regular music so I will likely cancel the service before the free trial period is up.",5,0.9473,Positive,139

I had read many reviews that were mostly very positive, but kept noticing some people had paired two and were blown away with the results. Now don't get me wrong, One is sufficient and fills the room, but two, well it's incredible. I did start off by purchasing one, but with the deal Amazon have at the moment for $169 I decided to go all in and get the second. I am so glad I did! Easy set up and pairing was a breeze. I didn't go for the Echo Sub like many have, as my use is mainly for music and not for the movie experience. Also Amazon no longer carry the Echo Sub, but it still can be bought from other outlets.

Hopefully, either Google or Amazon will get there, but it's still in Beta, as far as I'm concerned. The sound is really good. Linking two Echo Studio and one Echo Sub is maddening.

Amazon's customer service needs to be revamped. In order to keep call time moving, Amazon constantly switches the customer from one agent to another. Each time, the new agent needs time to read through the notes. That's not customer service, but rather customer disservice.

I got this studio with the intention of replacing the built in speakers on my main living room tv, which is only really used with a Fire TV Stick.

Setting up the device was a breeze, just as all echo devices are. The real exciting part was when creating the Audio System for the Fire TV stick, which also was an incredibly easy process, and then I was up and running.

Overall, while I am not a sound engineer, I think the sound quality was pretty incredible. Granted, I’m moving from built in tv speakers, however, the bass was punchy and smooth, balance feels great. When playing music, it’s a fully immersive sound that fills the room. While it doesn’t compare to a full scale surround sound system for movies or watching TV, it does sound great and is a very easy solution.

As all echo devices do, this studio integrates perfectly with my existing ecosystem, multi-room music, etc. There do appear to be a couple bugs, biggest one I found was when asking this device to play Spotify, it won’t play it on that device but in an entirely different room. I’ve seen reports of this bug and assuming that it’ll be fixed soon, as Amazon doesn’t seem to let bugs like this hang around too long.

490,"I’ve wanted a home theater for many years but have never been able to afford one.

When the Echo Studio came out I was interested and I purchased one.

When I found out that it could be used as part of a home theater set up I was very excited!

I already had the Fire Cube so I added a second Echo Studio and the Amazon Subwoofer.

At first I was very hopeful despite the many negative reviews that I’d read about using that set up as a home theater.

Sadly it turns out the negative reviews are correct.

I’ve had nothing but trouble with the Studios going offline for no reason on a very frequent basis.

And there is no reset button that I’m aware of so it means, in my case, climbing over furniture to unplug the Studio from the back of the device since I can’t reach the outlet where they are plugged in.

If this reset was only necessary rarely I wouldn’t mind as much but it’s gotten to be at least every two weeks if not more frequently especially lately.

Also on the Alexa app it keeps showing that the sub needs attention I have no idea what attention it needs but if I click on the sub the warning triangle symbol goes away until the next time I open the Alexa app and scroll through devices.

And the Echo Studios do not play nicely at all with the Amazon Recast.

That’s a daily nightmare with the audio when I watch a recording stuttering repeatedly and breaking up so badly that I have to keep rewinding the recording to try and hear the show.

Very annoying! 😡

I have to reset the Recast which is another pain as often the Recast claims that it’s suddenly not on the network so I can’t restart it via the Fire Cube TV.

Which is bizarre because I’ll check the network at the time and everything is fine, no settings were changed etc.

So then I have to unplug the Recast to get it to reset.

I wish that the Studio at least had a reset button that would cause the Studio to do a reboot as opposed to my having to climb over furniture just to unplug it and reboot the Studio.

All in all my dream of having my own home theater setup remains only that, a dream, because the Echo Studios and a Sub are no substitute for a real home theater set up.

I wanted to be happy with the Echo Studio but I’m not.

It needs more work to be a home theater system.

As a single stand alone speaker it may be adequate but that’s not what I was looking for, I wanted a home theater.

Your experience may differ but I will not recommend it as a home theater at this point.

When trying to fix it- its a 'network error' - and I've tried all the usual stuff and everything people suggest online with resetting everything from the router up, using the alexa app to remove the home theater group and remake it... then it works for an hour or two, then it cuts off again. Gotten to the point I just enjoy my bedroom tv and ignore the big living room one. Everyone does. I killed the shared living space.
And its really limited to Just the firestick- (I've also reset that stick many times) which is a bummer.
I wish that it came with a wire so that you had the backup option to just attach it directly to your tv.

I have two complaints, one I knew from another owner. The low end sounds contrived. This is to be expected since the are faking the base with a relatively small woofer. This is the small shortcoming I noticed. Not a deal breaker but it would be nice...

My biggest complaint is that Alexa in an Echo Studio is a bit hard of hearing. I have to speak very loudly in order to execute the command. My Echo Plus, Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Show are acceptably sensitive to inputs.

The problem is I really wanted to use these for a home theater. I see a lot of talk on the web about this and they do integrate fairly well with the Fire Cube. The imaging is awesome and the volume is perfect. What I found ruined the experience was the lack of bass.

Bass put out by the speakers is tight and accurate - it's quite good. There just is not enough of it for a small home theater. The experience is just ruined by it. Pairing this with a Echo Sub would be perfect, but that is discontinued. AMAZON PLEASE BRING BACK THE ECHO SUB!",3,0.9256,Positive,132
496,"With a built in 24bit DAC and excellent sound, Echo Studio is a winner. I spent significant time researching and in search of a upgraded bluetooth or wi-fi speaker to pair with the newly released Amazon HD music service. There's always give and take with Hi-Fi purchases (in my opinion) and this was no different. Although there were a few speakers on the market that boasted slighter better audio performance, it was at a price point more than twice the Echo Studio and none the a 24bit or higher DAC built in. I have found the sound performance excellent and having the convenience of Alexia, it was a no-brainer. Currently, I am satisfied with the bass performance, I find no need for the add on sub-woofer. I will likely purchase more.
Set up was simple and when I purchase another one and if I decide to pair them, the Alexia app makes the pairing process.
Like anything else, I also see some opportunity for improvement. I was disappointed there was not a built in Ethernet port. (I purchased a USB3 Ethernet adapter, however not tested it yet, 5G Wi-Fi is doing the trick) This speaker is not as visually appealing as a few of the other hi-fi spearkers I was looking at however, as stated above, none had the total benefits of the Echo Studio.",5,0.9716,Positive,225

On it's own it sounds great compared to previous Echos, but playing the same song right next to the Sonos One allows you to hear that it is not as clean/crisp. It sounds kinda muffled. I expected the lows to sound a lot better on this than the Sonos since it has a 5"" downward firing sub where the Sonos is just a single speaker. Lows sound good but not by much.
The biggest disappointment is that even the microphones to invoke Alexa aren't as good as the Sonos or even my older Echo, not sure what's going on there. I'll stick to the Sonos and send this one back.",3,0.6171,Positive,133
498,"I got the Echo Studio to use with a TCL ROKU TV. We have the TV in a custom made enclosure and there is no good place to add a sound bar. The Echo Studio can be connected via blue tooth if you use an iPhone as an intermediary (the TV will NOT connect directly to the Echo Studio via blue tooth). Using the iPhone as an intermediary works fine, except there is too much delay - the sound does not match the speaker’s lips. Because of that, I connect the TV to the Echo Studio with a cable, and that works just fine.
The sound on this system is quite good, especially for the price. However, if you are really picky about sound quality you may want to consider something more expensive like a Bose system.
I also use the Echo Studio to just play music from the TV or my iPhone. Again, the sound quality is very good for something in this price range - strong bass and treble, and plenty of power.
All-in-all, this is a good unit and it is more than adequate for many situations.",5,0.9527,Positive,190
499,"As an upgrade from the first generation echo, I expected the studio (with accompanying subwoofer) to sound much better, more bass and much improved sound quality. I was let down.

500,"I may end up liking this 5 stars eventually, but not now. The sound is very good. I was using the Echo. There is one problem I have not solved....... when I have Amazon music stations playing, it will play for a while... then all of a sudden it makes horrible noises that continue. I don't know how to describe it--- maybe like people talking or noises underwater.. and it is loud. Garbled noises. It looks nice. Bigger than I expected. One other thing I do not like is I can't see the light on top like I could with the Echo. I suspect the noise problem has something to do with the connection, but I have no wireless problems with my Echos, internet, or Roku TV.",3,0.6641,Positive,127
501,"Sound is ok. It is better than Amazon's other options but it won't blow you away. Stereo option while ""easy"" to set up did take multiple tries for it to work correctly. I also had quite a bit of difficulty getting these to work as part of a multi room group. I ended up having to delete all my groups and start from scratch after which it worked flawlessly. I'm also taking a star away because Amazon still doesn't have a way for one to listen to music they already own on the multi-room group. Paid apps exist to be able to play music you might have on your computer but it will only play over one speaker at a time which really limits the utility of this speaker ecosystem.",3,0.9032,Positive,130
502,"Like a lot of folks, we cut our cable and phone subscription to save a bundle each month and instead bought an Amazon Fire stick to watch tv through Amazon prime, and subscribed to Netflix and Hulu. (We also have mesh wifi for improved wifi coverage.) We then bought the Echo Studio which immediately 'found' our Fire tv and played sound from our tv. Great! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, it is perfectly good quality sound at a very good price (I waited for it to come on sale), and at least as good as expensive soundbar. (No one noticed when I replaced the soundbar with the Echo.) And the Echo Studio can be had for about half the price of the competing speakers and integrates very easily with other Alexa devices after running the quick automatic search. What's more, we just play our Spotify tunes all day through the Echo speaker -- and we find it is more than adequate to fill a very large living room while I'm working in an adjacent office. Plus, we could always add the Echo sub-woofer at some point in the future if we want more heft but for now it is than adequate. We don't use voice recognition often, but no problems so far. *** However, one grumble: quite a few times we've noticed an irksome delay with the tv -- that is, the lips of the actors on the tv move and there is a slight but irksome delay before we hear their voices through the speaker. In other words, the speaker doesn't synch precisely with tv. If there is an easy solution for this, please let me know! Thank you! ***",5,0.9827,Positive,282
503,"Seriously? $200 for a smart speaker that worked for about 6 weeks then constantly lost connection and went offline. Must be a common fail as Amazon decided to only allow a 30 day return window when all other Alexa type products have a year. Amazon offered to replace with a refurbished one. Refurbished = Broken and repaired. I know what kind of ""technicians"" test and repair these things. Hard pass. I could understand this if it had been a year or two under warranty but 6 weeks?",1,-0.4784,Negative,87

I specifically bought it so that it would be in the same echo system as my other Alexa enabled devices. So, now, If I want the Echo Studio to serve as a home theater speaker for my TV, I have to buy a Fire TV device to put on my Fire TV. Seriously!!!!

Not to mention that on the Studio, Alexa often doesn't respond. I have tried, ""Alexa, find my devices."" and she never responds. I have tried, ""Alexa, check for updates."" and she never responds.

What gives? This is why I usually wait for subsequent versions to come out. I have learned my lesson. All I have now is a really expensive speaker that I can stream audio through.",2,-0.8677,Negative,152

At higher volumes it doesn't have me saying that sounds great. Maybe I was expecting too much. However considering it's more than 6 times the cost of an Echo Dot it shold leave me feeling that I really have something exceptional. The sound is not that great. I'll keep playing with it and see if I can get it to perform at a level that makes me feel it was worth the extra $.,3,0.4096,Positive,105
506,"This is far superior in sound quality to the Echo 3rd generation, and a really good buy at the current discount price. Fills my moderate sized living room with solid feel at only half volume. Alexa responds very well even while noise level is moderate. Base is good for a 5.25"" woofer. Upper and midrange frequencies very clear. A really good speaker. Best I've heard anywhere near this price point and I have a pair of BA bookshelf speakers of lesser sound quality at a higher price. Stereo feel of the Studio is better than the BAs somehow.
Ingenious design.

The only issue I have with this along with every Alexa Echo is ""her"" constantly announcing where it's connected to via bluetooth at a very loud volume, all hours of the night or during Zoom meetings and online school. It is the most annoying thing ever and apparently customers have been begging Amazon for a firmware update to fix this issue but they have never cared to respond on the matter and for that I give this 3 stars.

This works better but still get dropped audio signal on occasion. My internet is Gigabit Fios on a Mesh router.

Amazon doesn’t seem to acknowledge the issue.

I was able to test the fruity model in the fruity store and was impressed with the sound. I was a bit leery to buy this without testing it, but I decided to try it for the sole reason that it works with all products and isn’t limited to fruity devices. It even has an aux input - every speaker of this nature should have this honestly.
Now the actual performance of this speaker in a 17’ x 25’ room is phenomenal. Smaller speakers made an echo effect. This speaker fills the room with sound without any such effect.",5,0.6652,Positive,125

However, I initially bought Homepod and set it up that was not as friendly as I expected, when I found out that I couldn’t access Pandora, iHreart that’s what it turned me off and I did returned it back at Best Buy and bought Amazon Studio that was so much easier to activated and I was fascinated with its bass sound that I am enjoying it every beat of it.",5,0.9568,Positive,85

If you accept to have your account added before it ships, when it arrives all you need to do is literally TURN IT ON. It will automatically connect to your wifi by using your password saved via your account profile and activate in seconds!

OK - so now to the sound. I used the sample HD playlist they let you stream to see how that sounds. It fills the entire room, with rich tones and dynamic range. I cranked it to the loudest setting and noticed something. The sound was still clear, but it was not blaring and distorted. The sound just sounded clean and I enjoyed every song. I walked to different rooms around the house and it actually travelled through. I can only imagine pairing 2 studios, which I may do at some point in the near future.

I also own an Echo and the sound is loud for this device - but it lacks the range. It also feels harsh if you blast it. The studio has definitely improved sound quality.

As for the HD music, I did not subscribe since I have a Spotify account. So I made sure my account had the highest bit rate streaming at 320Kb and guess what, it makes a difference using the studio. I now enjoy listening to music whenever I’m home. It feels great having good quality audio delivered at your command. I’m happy with this purchase 😊",5,0.996,Positive,256

Sound does not disappoint; it is clear, powerful, and ""carries"" much better than my old Echo 1st Gen device. We can hear it clearly in multiple rooms without being extremely loud.

My one frustration was that as the Echo devices that conform to the room, it requires resetting if you move it from one to another for proper detection of room acoustics. That means I had to deregister and re-register; I am not sure why a command to reset the acoustics is not available.",5,0.9298,Positive,114

I wasn’t overly impressed with the default sound setting, but the user can adjust the bass, treble and mid-range sound to their liking and the size of room the speaker’s in. Buying it on prime day and using my points/credits on my Amazon Visa, I got it at half price. It’s still probably worth full price if you enjoy listening to music. I anxiously await more of Amazon’s music to be “3D.” The only bummer is you have to upgrade your music subscription to get the benefit of 3D music, but it’s just a few dollars a month.",5,0.9437,Positive,120

I have fast internet, and I have no problems with online services using other computers around the house. But the thing things annoyed me the most is the constant lag for audio when using the YouTube app. None of the other apps I use on the Fire Stick 4k has this problem.

One More Thing: The Alexa wasn't connecting to my windows 10 via Bluetooth so I contacted Amazon support and it turns out it the firmware wasn't working with windows and within 1-2 days they updated the firmware so it now connects.

I had to contact customer service 5 times before getting the first one replaced. At one point they even recommended I switch the outlet connections to fix my problems (come on).

Spotify is quite a bit better and the sound is quite good at low to moderate levels. Perfect for background music. As I turn the volume up, I notice some truncating of the highs and lows. I have not tried Amazon HD and know the bit rate is higher, so I expect a bit more improvement, but I can't imagine that it will reach true high fidelity sound, which is how I think of studio sound.

Volume controls do not work from the app. Constantly have to disable and reenable the Spotify skill. Volume of music will stay loud while alexas voice stays soft. It’s the buggiest echo interface I’ve ever used, and Amazon clearly has no interest in fixing these issues. Sounds nice when it works, but if you want to listen to spotify on your $200 speaker, get something else.

UPDATE
As of December 2020, Spotify issues seem to finally be fixed. But the speaker is still very buggy. At least once a week, it just stops working and needs to be rebooted. Just seems to struggle with basic function and connectivity much more than any other echo I’ve owned.

The sound is also... fine? It’s not bad but not close to what you can get from a good Bluetooth speaker in this price range (and poorer than some that cost less). It’s definitely not $100 better than a standard Echo, which is what I’d recommend buying instead.",3,0.832,Positive,185

Apple has the Spectrum App on the opening screen, Menu, Guide it all flows.

Wrong. They cannot. Strike 1. After weeks and weeks of owning the Echo Studio, we have now RECONNECTED a Bose Mini Soundlink to the Fire Cube because after weeks and weeks of factory restarts, reconnecting, linking and pairing, pairing and unpairing, and countless hours on Amazon troubleshooting chats (the SLOWEST customer service chats ever), I have given up on the home theater pairing. Strike 2 and 3. The connections are tenuous, drop constantly, and even when the speaker is linked with the Fire Cube, the sound doesn’t come through the speaker and remains on the TV. So frustrating. The sound link between the speakers for multi room music seems to be fairly reliable and therefore, we have decided they can be used for music but not home theater. We’ve resorted to a less expensive, smaller and older Bose speaker for the TV that is flawless in its linkage and provides adequate and trouble-free sound. The $300 in Echo speakers are, for multi room music only, overpriced and I would have returned these speakers a long time ago except we live outside the US and sending these back to the US is prohibitively expensive, and during these COVID times, almost impossible.

To be clear this thing is MUCH bigger than a standard Echo, our old one was on the coffee table, this one had to be moved to a side table, it's big. Don't get me wrong, the sound is good, but I expected more bass, and much better sound to justify the double in price. I would say it's closer to a 25% improvement in sound.

535,"The Echo Studio is a pretty good sounding smart speaker for the price and size. I like many things about this speaker, but it could've been better. So far the smart home hub feature has not worked for the three Phillips hue bulbs I own. I use to have a phillips hub but returned it when I got an Echo Plus. I sold that Echo last year and haven't had a way to control my smart bulbs since then. I am disappointed to say the Echo Studio does not work as a hub for my lights. There is a chance they are all malfunctioning or it is an operator error. As far as voice commands go, I recommend putting it about 12 inches away from any walls or solid objects. Since the speaker has 360 sound it will echo (pun intended) back to the mics and require you to pretty much yell to get Alexa to respond. I originally had it next to a wall and had experienced this so I can say for sure the speaker responds better being at least 12 inches from walls. The last thing I can think of that I really wanted but didn't get with this model is the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus does. I mean come on, really? I would have paid the extra 25 dollars for this convenience and to he honest I expect this feature from a semi high end speaker. You probably are wondering about the speaker sound at this point. It sounds great honestly. It is truly like a miniature home theater system with out the true stereo quality you get from surround sound speakers. There is a significant amount of bass and it actually blends well with the mids and highs. I can feel it vibrate my floor, but I should mention we have raised floors which are better at transmitting the vibrations than a concrete floor. I would give this speaker 5 stars had the hub feature actually worked and if it came with the ability to measure inside temperature like the Echo Plus. One last thing is not part of the review but more of a suggestion; if you get the Echo Studio, do yourself a favor and subscribe to music HD. I got my first month for half the cost which will normally run you 14.99/month for the cheaper subscription. The sound difference between regular Prime Music and the HD subscription is kind of like the difference between a regular speaker vs bass boosted headphones. Everything sounds more balanced and clear and you hear the sounds you normally only hear with a pair of headphones or a high quality speaker!",4,0.998,Positive,450
536,"I purchased the Echo Studio when it was on sale 169.99 and was excited to try this thing out. Well the excitement was short lived. The Bluetooth would connect just fine through Windows 10 PC (connected to my tv via hdmi) and would work fine until I asked Alexa to play a song. Once that happened the Bluetooth would disconnect and proceed to play the song forcing me to reconnect it. This happened every time right on que. Sometimes when the Bluetooth was reconnected there was no sound at all despite Windows 10 showing it connected. In addition the Bluetooth connection would also drop at random moments and while the speaker sounded pretty good at first that was short lived as well. One moment I had a great speaker and then for no reason it suddenly sounded like a cell phone speaker (no woofer/mids). Resetting or unplugging was no help. My Echo Plus was connected in the same fashion and produced none of the above problems working flawlessly. As mentioned in other reviews the placement of the light ring is annoying since you cant see it at eye level (where most people would probably have it) and the voice recognition would sometimes not work. Also I figured I would update the software to possibly fix any problems but the Studio reported back that it had the latest version. When I checked Amazon website the latest Studio software version according to Amazon site is 3389730436 however my Alexa app shows the software version as 3590965380 so I'm not sure if that matters? Well I decided I would give it another try since maybe I got a lemon?

I proceeded to initiate a replacement ticket and was directed to a customer service chat. I was told this was not possible and that I could return the product and just buy it again. When asked about the sale and if they would honor that price the customer service rep just repeated that they could only return it. I asked why and again was just asked if I wanted to return it. This product and process was not what I usually experience at Amazon and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the refund process was great as usual. Now I have to decide if I will pick another one up during the next sale which will most likely be Prime Day but this experience has left me looking for alternative options.",2,0.9692,Positive,410

However, I do find it hard to use sometimes with the connection logic. First, I need to download the app to start to use it and a lot of functions are only available through voice control. For example, I tried the radio function in the app but when I close the app in the background, it continues to play the music and I have to unplug it.
Overall, I think it gives me the best sound experience in this price range($150-$250) e.g better than bose home 300!

I paired the studio(s), the subwoofer, an echo, and an echo dot to create an ""Everywhere"" network throughout the house.

539,"When it works it’s fabulous but there are to many issues. While watching Marcella or Queen of the South on Netflix the sound is immense and theater like. One drawback the sub is inoperative when watching tv, hopefully firmware will correct that. When listening to music such as Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean and Do It Again by Steely Dan the sound easily fills my 19x26 great room. Two Echo Studios are paired with an Echo sub and they have plenty of power and punch for a $600 system. Even though listening to tv and music with this system is enjoyable there are to many headaches. Sometimes while sleeping Alexa will cycle the speakers and a tone is heard or you can hear her talking which is very annoying. At times sound will come from one speaker only or an echo can be heard on Netflix. Connectivity issues abound as well. The system will work flawless for days on end. Then they all loose connectivity or one is connected and the other is not or both indicate connected but no sound is heard. Mine are connected via Bluetooth and if the issues continue I’ll connect them via Toslink cable.",3,0.9636,Positive,199
540,"Can not do stereo with other echo devices if you bluetooth to say your computer. Devices outside the echo studio connect stereo via wifi, not bluetooth. It will only be in a stereo mode (studio, 2 echos) if you play from amazon music or such. Not blueyoothed to anyother device like a computer. You cannot change the input to output like you can with the echo plus and echo. It is input only. Amazon doesnt tell us these things, or at least any place I could find. Overall, I'm happy with the echo studio, just disappointed that the stereo setup will not work while the studio is blue toothed to a device such as a computer so i can play my own music.",3,0.9014,Positive,123
541,"I have been using this speaker for a week now. Sounds better than I expected. I bought this to put in my bathroom which does not have the greatest acoustics of course. It runs the sound test on its on, was simple. The sound is open, the 360 does add a little extra to a song. It doesn't sound quiet as sweet as my Mirage Speakers but close and for much less money. It is definitely worth the sale price of $199. Now If JEFF BEZOS would please direct his team to design a higher end version of this speaker with WiFi 6 built in and be capable of combining 6 of these for a full wireless surround sound system that would be SWEET and I would preorder one.
UPDATE: I have been using this speaker for a little over 3 weeks and the more I use it the more I like it especially with ultra HD songs, now upgraded to 5 stars and plan on buying another for my kitchen when it goes back on sale.",5,0.9712,Positive,177
542,"for me the echo Studio is genuinely a personal assistant. But it sound quality is such that I find myself listening to my favorite music. Alexa does so many things it would be impractical for me to go into all of it but one of the things I like is its ability to learn or should I say it adds more things that it can do for instance I was complaining to myself that I have to say Alexa for every single question it started getting annoying lo and behold 2 months into owning her she asks would I like to enable the multiple questions mode which means I can continue asking her without saying her name as many questions as I'd like the machine offers many opportunities for this type of situation as you get used to it like practicing martial arts the teacher keeps adding more things that you can do I highly recommend this piece of equipment even if you're going to college or you just want to get smarter about your everyday things for instance I am learning the phonetic alphabet, alpha, bravo, charlie, Etc. I'm also learning the periodic table. Obviously Alexa is teaching me all of this and they add many many things as time goes on for instance at the time of this they haven't added it but they told me it would be ready in another month sodoku I'm assuming that they meant audio sodoku I don't know but that should be interesting now for the bad unfortunately she has 10% cannot understand what I'm saying that might not sound like much but if you ask the same question a half a dozen different ways and you still don't get the answer you're looking for it can be annoying the only caveat from that is sometimes when she doesn't understand I learn something new and that'll take me down another road and I'll ask questions about it do yourself a service go online and look up dozens of people tricks that you can do with Alexa and things you can do the more people you watch and learn from and as she teaches you your mind will truly be blown from this machine!",4,0.9715,Positive,371
543,"Incredible speaker! So impressed with the sound quality - and power - what a difference from the previous small BT speaker that I had in my office. Set-up took a couple of attempts - but once the speaker was connected - wow - impressive. I paired it with a Echo Sub - and while I definitely had issues with the Sub (see my separate Echo Sub review) - the pairing of a Sub with the Studio is a must for the full immersion of sound. I listen to loud-angry-metalcore music, and the Studio does not disappoint.",5,0.964,Positive,96
544,"This is basically an oversized version of the Echo 3. It is bigger, fatter, perhaps a bit louder, but the sound quality is no better and the voice recognition and bass response are actually worse. I thought I was upgrading from the Echo 3 and was profoundly disappointed in this device. Even after upgrading to the HD music subscription, the sound is thin and tinny, with no bass to speak of and a far cry in terms of quality than what my old Sonos One produces. Echo 3 is a better, much cheaper option if you’re opting for an Amazon smart speaker.

A big disappointment that I can’t see recommending to anyone.",1,-0.9367,Negative,112
545,I am so impressed with this device. The sound quality is amazing for such a small package. I then learned I could use it as a sound bar with the right Firestick. Then I learned I could hook them up in stereo and get Dolby Atmos for my TV. Just today the Echo Studio went on sale for $169 I had to buy my third Studio so I can enjoy the clean crisp sounds in my bedroom. They offer a subwoofer that I don't think is necessary because the bass is booming. Way to go Amazon!,5,0.9427,Positive,96
546,"I originally got my first Aleza, an Echo Dot for the living room. One of the main reasons was music. I was very disappointed in the Dot. Returned it for the Studio, and am very happy with it. My house is not huge, 1,350 square feet, but I can play the Studio loud enough to be in a neighboring room and hear is really well. I have since gotten a few GE light switches for it to also control. Very nice.",4,0.8792,Positive,81
547,"I had a 48"" TV in bedroom where I was a bit underwhelmed by TV speakers. And I really wanted Alexa capability so I could croak out in the morning, ""Alexa, what time is it?"" This solved both problems. Sound is decent. It can't compete with the $2000 sound system downstairs, but it's only $200.

I had a little difficulty testing it with the free version of Amazon Music. Some tracks didn't play. (and why, oh why does it need the TV to play music?) I also tested what I THINK was a 5.1 stereo file. The stereo separation effect was minimal.",4,0.6791,Positive,102
548,"Definitely not a price point you'd normally expect to pay for a smart speaker. However, this thing rocks. It's a beast too, weighing in around 10lbs or so. That weight is due to the quality speakers and magnet drivers that the device uses. I wouldn't say it's Bang and Olufsen quality, but it's very good. It's able to detect the location of your voice as indicated by the ring. It supposedly adjusts the 3D sound based on room design, but I'm not sure how you prove that. It's also very loud if you want it to be. Love this thing and I think if it was about $30-$50 cheaper it would be the best deal on the web.",5,0.9607,Positive,118
549,"It's a good speaker and is good for the price but, given it's size, I was expecting it to perform more like a Sonos Play 5, but it's more in between a Play 1 and a Play 3. Glad I have it...

I will also say that I wish it came with a metal wrap like the Sonos because I'm a bit nervous that the fabric on the top and sides will get dirty or dusty, which prevents me from putting it in a lot of places I'd like to have one, but I'm using the echo dot for those places.",3,0.9778,Positive,101
550,"I like it. After the wife got out all connected, works great with my fire tv cube. I have it paired with an echo sub. We have it in our master bedroom and it fills the room adequately as the speaker for the TV. Together, the sub and studio were about 300. The soundbar and subwoofer I had before were more, a sony, and the new setup is better. The fire tv cube automatically added the remote to the studio. Can't do better for the money. It's not a movie theater, but it's a great little home theater feel/sound. The alexa Integration features are just as good at the other speakers which is a plus. Very happy.",5,0.9592,Positive,117
551,I purchased this speaker because of the dolby atmos feature. But in the last year that I had it amazon have released hardly any atmos content. I even think I read an article about how they basically have up on atmos content. I was sold for the atmos and have have only watched jack ryan with atmos. That it. I have two of these this for nothing basically. It would be nice if I could watch movies on vudu and take advantage of the atmos but amazon doesn't allow that.,5,0.8075,Positive,90
552,"The sound quality for music is better than the basic Echo, but it's not in the league with a quality speaker. The sound lacks ""presence."" It sounds like it's in the distance or the sound is coming through a window. I tried my favorite speaker evaluation songs, and I was disappointed on each one. I have a set of Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX computer speakers ($119) that provide much better sound.",2,0.9224,Positive,71

So Amazon one again you hit it OUT OF THE PARK with this upgrade keep it coming you make life so much more enjoyable!!!!!!!!!! So if you haven’t figured it out yet I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STUDIO!!!!!!!!!",5,0.9885,Positive,172
554,"While it commonly fails to pick up my voice compared to my other devices, it makes up for it in sounds quantity. Those thing will fill the room with sound. I plan to purchase another, add a sub and replace my home theater system with it.

I found a priest who delivers holy water on Uber eats though, which I can order through this speaker at a moment's notice.",4,-0.6597,Negative,92
555,"I have a 3rd gen Echo, a couple of 3rd gen Echo Dots, and a couple of Echo Inputs connected to powered speakers. The Studio provides some next-level sound, comparatively, and I am very happy with the quality, particularly when using all together for whole-house audio. I was very pleasantly surprised by the audio synchronization between my Bluetooth connected Bose Mini Soundlink, directly connected bookshelf speakers and the Studio. I expected some delay somewhere in the mix, but nope, it's right on. I've struggled with the notion of adding an Echo Subwoofer too, but the lows provided by the Studio are quite good, and I'm not sure it would make much of a difference. I do have the Studio placed fairly close to a corner, so sound clarity suffers a tiny bit, but it's pretty large, so leaving it out in the open is not ideal in my space.",5,0.3042,Positive,149
556,Can't skip songs when playing Spotify and when you ask Alexa to play Spotify it plays it but it plays it with commercials like you don't have a premium account don't know why but it doesn't make sense also be aware that you may be forever changing the volume on the Alexa studio and from your phone because it doesn't connect together you Alexa maybe at one volume and your phone might be at another overall the quality of the sound is good but there is a lot of bugs that need to be fixed especially with Spotify it wants you to use Amazon for your primary listening but not everyone likes it it's not user-friendly on the app you have to go through several obstacles just to get to the device settings and overall my opinion about Alexa is she doesn't listen well especially when asking to play something thru Spotify.,2,0.7924,Positive,152
557,"We had an Amazon Alexa Show 8 in the kitchen, but I wanted it for my room and we wanted a rich speaker that wouldn't be dominated by the sink faucet, dishwasher, and washer & dryer, so we got the Echo Studio with 3-D Audio. The setup with my Alexa phone app took only one minute and the music is a huge upgrade from the Show 8. Also, unlike the Show 8 which has a wall-wart, the Studio has a streamlined 2-prong power supply. We now also have the option of taking the Alexa Studio to the living room if we are ever (whenever that will be) entertaining, so this is a worthy upgrade in the sound department.",5,0.9509,Positive,118
558,"I have Echo devices throughout my home. Dots, Echo, Echo plusses, a sub and a Studio.

This studio fills the space it's in with premium sound. Great low end for everyday listening. In concert with the Echo Plusses and sub that are in the multi room group with this Studio my home has great balanced sound for hip hop, r&b, pop, podcast, and radio. I think this could be overkill for a small bedroom. Our floorplan is very open and therefore it's challenging to fill the entire space when full sound.

My only gripe is the price point. $200 is a bit much for a speaker. I purchased this on sale for about $160 when I had an extra $20 in my home budget.",4,0.8271,Positive,124
559,"Sorry to say but in the store the speaker sounded great. I put it into my home environment with normal furniture and artwork,,, it sounded tinny at best. Tried to love it... I really tried... but had to send it back.",3,0.9643,Positive,41
560,"Same height but about twice the diameter of the regular Echo. Also sounds 4x as good in terms of power output and clarity. I do not use the hi res audio option ( I tried it as a free trial using my laptop with a hdmi cable to my receiver and floor standing Polk audio speakers) I honestly couldn’t tell which songs were 44 kHz sampling vs 192. Maybe if I was younger I would have been able to).

I did notice that streamed audio from my IPhone didn’t sound great, ostensibly due to compression. Maybe because it is clearer, these differences are more apparent.

I’d buy another one.",5,0.9735,Positive,109
561,"Let's just say I've been. Waiting some time deciding what I want as a home audio system. Sonos products look and sound great but I ultimately decided to go with the 3D studio for the more bass sound over highs. I think the studio offers a good balance that's adjustable enough ( we'll come back to these said adjustments in a minute) to get the highs, why not as crisp as Sonos, pretty close indeed.

Ok so let's be clear, the easy setup that I watched tons of videos before the product arrived wasn't easy. Yes it connected to WiFi and adjusted based on the placement of my room but getting it connected to my fire TV was almost a phone call away to tech support. Actually I was on the phone waiting for tech support when I somehow miraculously connected it. It's a moment you will realize as a Firestick 4k owner that your Firestick does not update it's software automatically.

The speaker itself is a little bulky but honestly it makes it look more of a beast than the Sonos product I was considering. The one deciding point was the ability to connect other Bluetooth devices directly to the speaker and I'm glad I did. That feature is the most useful as someone using a phone, tablet, computer and fire TV to listen to music or watch movies it switches effortlessly between whatever audio I decide to play.

The audio setting which allows some tweaking to the bass, treble and mids is probably my only complain for the moment. I definitely think there's limited options for adjustments for the echo studio. There should be some pre-sets to assist with adjustments for movies, music and games. There definitely should be a way to adjust the individual tweeter's that create the 3D sound, that by the way you don't get to hear unless you subscribe to Amazon music service. The surround sound provided by the stereo spacial enhancement does help to mimic that pretty good. Also note adding thrid party software such as the Dolby and Atmos on my PC when using this device showed great improvement. It's unfortunate I can't carry that over to my Firestick and some other devices. My other complaint which I will contact support about is when I adjust the few setting options they give me it doesn't save and keep it. At some point when I open settings option again it resets back to it's original options.

Overall I enjoy the speaker and can't wait to purchase the subwoofer and a additional echo studio to complete the ultimate home audio.",4,0.9969,Positive,436
562,it sounds good but the bad part is u gotta buy 2 of them for it to sound like a 2.1 because u can listen to the studio in hd or ultra and if u dont have the sub then it sounds like some of the voice is lower than the band...and they say the more u buy (and u can connect 100's of units and subs and the sound will then feel like a big theatre) it sits well on my dresser and beside it is a show 10 but my review is 2 thumbs up for the echo! 😎,4,0.8777,Positive,101
563,"Got this as a Xmas present and upgraded from the gen 1 echo to this one. It is a complete night and day difference. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch but I can hear the difference in sound quality between this and the gen 1 echo. The sound on this speaker is so much deeper, richer and clearer. The only downside is that the light ring isn't visible on the side of the device and the response ding isnt as loud as on the gen 1 so I can't as easily tell if the echo heard me. With that being said it does a very good job of hearing me and understanding what I'm asking. There has only been a handful of times where it didnt hear me and its when it was blasting music. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good sounding smart speaker.",5,0.9658,Positive,150

Y no precisamente es mi proveedor de internet o mi router ya que tengo equipos nuevos de alta calidad que superan los $400 dólares y aún así el sonido es pobre por tanta interrupción del sonido.

Amazon music service works flawlessly on this device. I even bluetooth my phone with it and use it to play the sound to some pinball games for maximum affect. We also use the drop in feature with a granddaughter who loves to check in. To summarize, this speaker has added true value to the home in multiple ways.

Also, it does the room calibration on setup but not when you unplug it and move it to another room as promised. You would have to remove it and set it up again.

568,"The Echo Studio is a substantial upgrade to previous Echos.

1. Deep, full base.
2. Can be modified by a basic equalizer in the Amazon Alexa app on my phone.
3. Tailored its sound to my PC room for a great sound.

I upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited HD, as standard Amazon Music Unlimited sounds very dull in comparison. It was worth it to me to spend an additional $50 annually for the major improvement in sound quality.

The only negative that I have noticed is that the vocals on some songs seem a little weak, but this really doesn't detract from the Echo Studio's otherwise stellar sound.

I may add another Echo Studio this summer, and pair them in stereo, as other reviewers have suggested. These units may not be audiophile quality, but they are a terrific value for the size and price. I enjoy listening to all genres of music, from classical, rock, country, easy listening, blues, jazz and RB. There are many songs available to put this unit through its paces, and a good one, which is also a fun listen, is ""Das Spiegel"" by the Chemical Brothers.

For a large room the Studio is a must unless you have multiple standard Echo units. The sound of the Studio is huge and clear when you get past half volume. At low volumes the Studio lacks bass were the standard Echo does not. The Studio is worth the money IMO.

The thing is Apple’s pricing is in my opinion extremely greedy, I mean something isn’t right when a new phone comes in at $1,000 plus.

My brother has a regular Echo and the Studio is amazing sound compared to my brother's. The Studio automatically adjusts to the room acoustics to best put out Hi-Fi sound. Just one Studio fills the room with music but I added an Echo Sub to my Studio to power up the bass. They are awesome together.

However, you can adjust the setting through the Alex app to give a little improvement for the highs or as much bass as you want. With that said, the Echo Studio is a great addition to any home-theater. Currently I only have one, but will soon purchase another one as well as the Echo Sub. Even with only one speaker, it can fill a mid to large size room with great sound. It connected to my Fire TV Cube quick and easy. I can't wait to purchase the other pieces to setup my system.

Amazon I would expect much more out of your technology. I’m constantly having to fiddle with a costly sound system that does not deliver.

The music sound quality is noticeably better than smaller units. The sound is rich with full bass.

I can be on a different floor and the sound quality blows me away, It is comparable or better than the Bose Sound Wave imo. I paired the Echo Studio with a Dot for surround sound.
It feels sturdy and solid, doesn't take up much room. Alexa sometimes has issues but it very well could be my wifi when it flashes red I just unplug it for a minute, then it's fine..

I was hoping to get a second one to use in stereo for a home theater, but have just canceled due to issues pairing it with my new Samsung frame tv. I have gotten it connected to my tv with the optical cable and with Bluetooth, but pairing is inconsistent. With the optical cable the audio has just stopped randomly playing and reconnecting doesn’t work. If I try again a few days later it works again, but still very annoying in the middle of a movie. Alexa also can’t find my tv with voice control, so I have to use the Alexa app to connect, but you have to reconnect every-time you turn the tv on, and occasionally it won’t connect through the app either. Never had these problems with connecting to my phone, only with the tv.",4,0.6751,Positive,157

I even set a voice command to have it connect when using my PS4. For movies it's pretty amazing for movies and works perfectly with my fire tv.

Only downside for me is if I just ask alexa to play music directly it will only play from one speaker.. if i use the amazon music app through fire tv then I can get them both. Since the fire tv is what allows them to pair together it makes sense though.",5,0.9393,Positive,117
587,"I recently moved and have been looking at the Studio for a while. I'm so happy I pulled the trigger on this bad-boy! Shortly after plugging it in, it performed a room test to optimize the sound. Once completed, I had it play one of my favorite songs. It did NOT disappoint.

The sound is SO good, my 20-year old son heard it and immediately purchased one for his apartment. The bass was so loud, his neighbors had to tell him to turn it down one-night last week. If you're looking for great sound at a fair price AND Alexa integration, don't wait, just get it.",5,0.9797,Positive,106
588,"The unit seems solid and well built, but I was expecting better sound reproduction. I personally would have liked a better bass response rather than having to purchase a subwoofer.

It does work over my wi-fi but I’m unable to link the device to control it under the smart home skill.",4,0.9524,Positive,75

It's not as good as the Homepod in sound quality (but honestly, Siri is still terrible) and not nearly as good as the Google Max speakers (the best of the lot) but, for the price, they've come a long way. I paired two together for a decent, acceptable sound. Clear mids and highs, the bass is adequate and not too ""boomy"" or muddy. The pair can get pretty loud without breaking up. Decent speaker(s) either by itself or as a pair when they go on sale. DO NOT waste your money on the sub-woofer. That's a joke and Amazon should be embarrassed by that failure.",4,0.9508,Positive,113
590,Have many speakers. Try many speakers. This echo studio sound quality doesn't surprise me at all. The only thing it wow me. It's the set up sound. After that.

The sound quality is just phenomenal and beyond my expectations. I always had an issues with Sonos play bar with low mids and vocal. This echo studio setup has great mids and vocals.

The device is solidly built and weighs a couple of pounds. The device responds to my voice even when I have the thing on max volume. The bass is deep and I haven’t heard any distortion of the other speakers. Alexa can be a little bit annoying when it doesn’t understand the words I’m saying so I have to ask it a few times using different ways of saying the same thing.
Over all I like this device and I’d certainly recommend it.",5,0.9271,Positive,109

Often both hear the same command but the echo studio almost always hears it wrong and the first gen echo hears correctly, even I'm standing right by the studio. Sometimes Ive asked it to play music and I hear some very loud static white noise instead. The sound quality is disappointing given the hype. the bass is ""better"" (boomier) than the standard echo but the gen 1 echo still has better overall sound, much clearer highs and mids (vs even the gen 3 echo plus which we also own) than the echo studio. I've tried the published tricks for the studio to improve sound and the improvement is marginal. I hope some future software updates will improve it but in it's current state its a not a well conceived product.",2,0.9383,Positive,148

The hub became unusable. So the Studio connected to most of them, but not all. Some of the really old non zigbee are done, but they were really old. All of the silvania br30 color bulbs instantly connected to the studio, and all the AGSHOME ZIGBEE Motion Sensors connected perfectly.

596,"I had wanted to order another Echo Sub to pair with the Echo Show I use in my office, but it seems those are no longer available. I'd not heard of the Echo Studio, but took a chance and ordered one. The set up proved easier than any of my previous Echoes. Which is simply to say it worked immediately with little effort from me. I'm using the Echo Show for most Alexa purposes, so just created a speaker group with the Studio, and turned off its microphone. This combination is doing just what I wanted; great sound quality with the two working in tandem, and the bass coming from the Studio is a great improvement.",5,0.9739,Positive,116
597,"It is not a $500 studio speaker, but close enough to be well worth the price and taking two into your home, for music and for Alexa smart speaker functions.

They will fill the largest living room with super clear sound. Just say, ""Alexa, play Run by Leona Lewis"" and these two stereo speakers will blow your mind!

Yes, I like it for music (although vocals in some songs can get drowned out a bit) but for listening to audio books, or just asking Alexa/Echo questions, the voice is too loud has way too much bass and sounds unnatural/muddy. Also, I use the timer all the time while cooking, it always blasts way too loud. Hopefully Amazon can tweak the settings for lower volume for everything other than music, and more natural sounding voices.",4,0.8216,Positive,100

I use Alexa at home and with my car.",2,0.5857,Positive,80
600,"I love the device and the sound it produces but there's a very annoying problem with Alexa Echo Studio recognizing some music artists. For example, it would not recognize famous singer, Jack Jones but repeatedly played Jax Jones. It also does not recognize foreign sounding names either. I contacted support and was told the device is new on the market and there are issues that still need to be resolved. Really disappointing because I bought it thinking it would play what I wanted.

8 months later as of July 31, 2020, still no improvement in Alexa Studio recognizing a number of commands. Often trouble recognizing my playlists. I sometimes need to spell the name before recognition works. I speak clearly, loudly and slowly and even that sometimes doesn't work. The sound is wonderful but Alexa's ability to recognize what is being asked is very unstable.",5,0.3058,Positive,145

It wasn't until I walked away from the workstation into the middle of the room I realized how much fuller and vibrant the sound was. I relocated the Echo Studio to lower shelf close to level of my ears while sitting and it is a VAST improvement.

I have a few other Echos so I was familiar with Alexa and this device handles Alexa like all the others.

With the home automation, you need to have a home automation system (I have Wink) that integrates with Alexa. This is not clear in the Echo Studio description. It infers home automation directly with Echo. This is the same function as with the Echo Dot.",5,0.85,Positive,137
602,This is surprisingly a great addition to my home entertainment!!!! At first I was a little skeptical because I've always been a BOSE fan but I have to say for there first try at a high end room filling sound system there pretty close not quite there yet bit I'm sure just like all there other speaker products they will nail it on the next generation model...,4,0.9506,Positive,67
603,"So I use this speaker oll over the house.....yes it sometimes doesnt sound as good in spots....but it's meant to be a 3d like speaker for all around....so placing it near walls and stuff would effect its sound. Ive used this speaker out doors....and it can really rock an outside party. Soooooo loud. Sounded more amazing outside to be honest.

As always there are flaws.....but these flaws are tyoically based on Wi-Fi. Like lower end Wi-Fi that cant support too many items. I know the 3.5 is optical....but it says aux too so I tried it....and it in fact works....but at half volume. The only app I use now is Amazon music. But even with that....i dind myself searching for songs.....unkike YouTube where my songs typically pop up when listening to other similar songs. Amazing music varied so much each time I chose the my music playlist. I never liked ANY of the songs.

604,"It’s a decent speaker, and works just like other echoes, but the selling point for the extra $120 was to get that awesome sound during our movie watching.

Here’s what you need to know, if you have a Fire TV Edition Television (Insignia, or Toshiba etc...) this will not give you the home theater experience. Also, if you connect your TV via optical cable, the TV remote control will not pair with the echo studio, so you won’t be able to adjust the volume with your remote. It’s got good sound, and I like listening to music on it, but home theatre on Fire TV editions is a big no-go.",3,0.8519,Positive,110
605,"This purchase was a leap of faith into the world of smart speakers that turned out to far exceed my expectations. As always, the studio was easy to set up (took less than 2 min) and the resulting sound was absolutely impressive, complete night and day difference when compared to older echo. Although the bass was strong, clear and added the needed depth I was so impressed with the studio that I purchased the echo sub along with a second studio to create a true stereo environment feeding off of my prime music HD subscription. With the price point, quality and ease of use, Echo Studio is an absolute win for Amazon...and for me the end user.",5,0.985,Positive,117
606,"These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.

The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.

My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.

When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.

The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.

I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.

Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.

In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.

So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.

In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.

So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.

With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.

Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.

In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.

Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.

Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.",4,0.9979,Positive,1135
607,Definitely not impressed with the sound quality. I made the decision to purchase based on various online reviews rating it closely to another product I own which is a Marshall Kilburn yes I know the Kilburn costs $100 more than the Studio but reviews were comparing them as close. Next i know the Kilburn is not the best measure but I happen to own one because I love the convince of being able to carry it around and take it outside. Lastly If you have a large room 20x25 with vaulted ceilings it just doesn’t fill the room. It gets loud but again it doesn’t seem to surround you. If you have audiophile grade or even close to audiophile grade equipment I would recommend going with another option.,2,0.8369,Positive,128
608,"I was hoping for room-filling sound with range and volume but left disappointed given the size and sturdy feel of this Echo device. For my ears, and I’m no audiophile, I feel that I get something more pleasing out of the Echo 3rd gen. I was incredibly surprised by this but when I realized I didn’t like what I was hearing out of the Studio, I replaced it with the Echo 3rd gen and was pleased. Would the sound be rounded out and more full with the Echo sub? Probably. But if I’m going to have an Echo sub to accompany my Echo Studio, why not just get the Echo and add a sub? I am sad that the Studio didn’t blow me away. I’ve compared it to a Sonos One and at the price, the Sonos One out performs the Studio in my opinion. In the end, the Studio probably more accurately reproduces audio compared to the Echo, but it’s all about function for me and the Echo suits my fancy and happens to be considerably less expensive.",3,0.726,Positive,179

It really does a good job on it's own, however, I think it kicks up a notch just by simply pairing it with a couple of echo dots also in the room. If I had a couple of Echo's paired instead I am sure that it would even be a richer experience than it is now. I am curious as to how the echo sub added to the mix would improve the sound. Currently the bass delivered by the Echo Studio alone isn't bad at all. Maybe I will make that addition in future, but right now I am quite satisfied.",5,0.9184,Positive,113

Pros:
-Like the other echos, it's all-around a great smarthome device.
-Decent music compared to the smaller echos.
-I can tell the audio quality has slightly more range than the echo plus and can be moderately louder than the plus.
Cons:
-Despite having more audio range the music doesn't actually sound that much better than an echo plus. This is not really acceptable when the device takes up twice the space. In some scenarios, the audio is worse. Disabling the sound enhancement feature helps the audio quality for most songs. I can tell it was updated at some point to work better, so you can leave it on now, but still needs more patching.

However, the Dolby Atmos really enhances the sound and fills my 15'x10' office and I got this on sale for $159 (with 2 Hue light bulbs). With Amazon Music HD, it integrates so well and you don't have to ask Alexa to ask Sonos to play specifically from Amazon. I do prefer quality, but for ease and the good integration with Amazon services, this fit my requirements in my office. As for voice recognition, sometimes Alexa in general just doesn't quite understand some things (especially if you have an accent) and searches aren't as good as Google home's. When I deep listen, I go to my Sonos setup.",4,0.9195,Positive,134

Inside the house though, the sound falls short. Everything sounds diffuse, and the speaker seems very directional. I have found no instances where the speaker 'disappears'. The breathy tone/delivery of music on the device makes me wonder if the high bit rate of Amazon Music HD isn't totally wasted with the Echo Studio.",2,0.7611,Positive,91

I have an Amazon Music HD subscription which allows me to download Ultra HD audio to my computer for playback on the Studio. The sound of the Studio is outstanding, but I didn't get the full benefit I wanted until I adjusted the equalizer on the Alexa app on my phone. I brought the bass, mids and highs over to the plus side and that worked for me. The sound quality of the Studio is great. I'm very happy with my purchase.",5,0.9637,Positive,107
636,"Great echo device. After having an echo 1st generation for years, it was time to upgrade. Since we listen to music so much, I wanted one with better sound and this has that in spades. Listening to music through the Studio is a much better experience. Bigger (around) and heavier, but that is and should be expected. It's not audiophile quality, but that's fine - it's more than good enough. Even though the bass response (which is tight and loud) is fine, when the echo sub is available again, I'll be adding that.

Tried another customer service agent who was clueless wanted me to wait 4 days for an answer as to how to resolve the problem.

In fact, I plugged it in and my Alexa app on the phone immediately recognized the device and automatically set it up. Whole process took less than 10 min. It is easy to use and fits my need to have all my Echo sync together to create a smart home. The only downside is that the sound quality is not as impressive.

So many obscene words and I was so shocked that this is the first thing that Amazon wanted new owners to hear that I couldn't speak for a minute and had to pull the plug to make it stop.

It integrates well with other Echos but they have to be 2nd generation or greater, and they all have to be on the same wi-fi. The app has a basic equalizer you can fine-tune the sound with (just mid, highs, and lows).

I bought one to connect with my fire tv cube for home theater use and to play HD and 3D music off of my Amazon Music HD subscription. It worked so well and sounded so great that I ordered a second one a day later. Now I have two and can use for proper home theater effect (including Dolby Atmos -- which is very, very cool, btw!).....and with two I can enjoy stereo when streaming music.
The low end that even ONE of these echo studios delivers is pretty awesome. With the three midrange drivers facing L, R and one toward the ceiling it really does make these units sound larger than they are by bouncing mid-frequency sounds off of walls and ceiling, very spacious and full sound.

661,"I've owned several speakers in my life, but this is the first smart speaker I buy. Here are the things I liked and disliked about this Echo Studio.

Things I like:
- The sound is excellent. Is not perfect and is not the best sound I heard in a speaker. Given the 199$ (or 169$ if on sale), this is great value for money. The bass is punchy but not extremely powerful, and the mids and treble are somewhat muffled and covered by the low frequencies. An adjustment with the Alexa app makes a big improvement.
- The ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"" really gives the sound a nice touch. I can feel the speaker fill the room.
- Alexa's voice recognition is almost perfect. It always heard me, even several ft away. The problem was when whispering. 30% of the time Alexa just wounldn't recognize me.
- The ability to connect via Bluetooth to a phone or computer is simply a must. The Homepod does not have this capability, but Echo does.

Things I don't like:
- The sound is loud, but not as loud as one expects given the size and weight of the speaker. Other speakers are way smaller and give the same or more volume.
- Alexa's skills may not work on all devices and/or regions. As an example: I have two smart switches from Xiaomi and I couldn't make them work with Alexa (I could with Google Assistant). Also, Spotify (and maybe even other platforms) is not functional in regions outside US or Europe. I live in Argentina and had to change my location before connecting Spotify with Alexa.

Overall, given the price I'm absolutely pleased with the speaker. Having read other reviews, I'm convinced that pairing two studios with an Echo Sub makes a powerful and great sounding combo, for not that much money.",4,0.9906,Positive,308

I hooked up an echo dot to the sound bar so they would have equal amazon integration. They are both excellent values but the Studio sounded better for music. The sound was more balanced and was certainly better at lower volumes. The soundbar w/sub was great if played loudly but this was probably due to the impressive bass and when played at low/mid volumes the bass either dominated or just didn't fit with what the bar was putting out. The studio's bass was sufficient for me but I could always add the sub down the road. We ended up hooking it up through a firestick and now our TV plays through it as well. It's not the same as our home theater set up in the basement but it's great for what we watch most of the time. I""m not sure about the 3D music effect but think if I ever paired it to another one that it would be an amazing set up.",5,0.9916,Positive,199

The Echo Speaker functioning is not the issue but the Alexa App for Android is terrible to set it up easy. Also, once I connected the Audio Cable the Pairing is dismissed.

I still didn't try to connect my Home Therter System using Sony TV with Bose Sound Touch 300 System yet that Amazon will push me to purchse the Amazon Fire TV Cube for sure.
Pairing the Echo Studio is miserable and no fun at all.

After many trials to pairing of the Two Echo Studio, I've replaced and relocated the Router center of the Echo Studio from other side of Room and It is now working as Pairing. As result, Echo Studio [Built-In Wireless Adapter] is performing very poor signals. The Router must be placed near to the each Echo Studio units to success Pairing and maintain the Pairing mode.

Playing Amazon and Sportify (Favorite Songs) Music from my Computer to these Echo Studio is not possible unless via Alexa Command, I've installed 3.5mm Audio Stereo splitter from the Computer Audio output and using 3.5 mm Audio Cable to connect to both Echo Studio to play any music from the computer including YouTubes.
The Result of using the Audio Cable is lot Clear and Better Sounding than via WIFI and much louder as well.

665,"Update: 5/23: Revising my review since the issues with audio loss requiring me to reboot the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Echo Studio a few times a week are gone. Most likely it was a bug that was fixed in a software update to one of the devices. My only complaint now is that the only multichannel input for non-Fire TV devices is optical and thus limited to DD and not DD+ or Atmos.

Original Review: I bought this to improve the sound from my TV. Since I use a Fire TV Stick 4K as the only source, I was excited to give it a try and I really love the integration with the volume control from the Fire TV remote controlling the Echo Studio perfectly. I'm also happy with the sound quality and really enjoy it when it is working. The problem that brings me to two stars is that the audio will occasionally cut out when playing from the Fire TV Stick 4K and the only way to recover is to reboot the devices. Thinking it was network related I tried a different access point with WiFi to both, ethernet to just the Stick 4K, ethernet to just the Echo Studio, ethernet to both, and the issue does not go away. It happens often enough (every 2 days or so) that I had to go back to the TV speakers to stop my family from complaining so now the Echo Studio sits collecting dust.",4,0.6984,Positive,247

671,Voice recognition and sound quality is great. It was so great I decided to buy a second Amazon Echo Studio. My delivery showed up and I raced downstairs like a kid at Christmas. I Opened the box and took the speaker out of it’s nice presentation bag. Plugged it in and created a home living room group. Threw on some dirty bird house music which has very good low end and through Spotify they were bumping! It wasn’t until later that I open up one of my DJ apps on my iPad Pro and try to connect them both through YouTube that I realized I made a mistake. There’s no way to pair or daisychain these off of Bluetooth they will only play out of the Alexa app or through a fire stick. I think I'm going to do is buy a dongle with a HDMI out and use a fire stick. Currently that HDMI out is going to a big screen for visuals but we'll figure it out at work around.,3,0.7114,Positive,172
672,I upgraded my Echo + to the Studio for 2 reasons. One was to get 3D music and better sound from Amazon Music which this works well for. The second is to utilize the Studio to get Atmos from my Toshiba FireTV. This is where I was let down. It turns out that the stereo integration only works with Gen 3 TV's. My TV is a Gen 2. It would be nice to get a firmware update to the TV to allow integration so I can use it for Atmos. Music does sound great though. I may pair it with an Echo sub for better bass.,5,0.9468,Positive,106
673,This was received as an upgrade to the original Echo that we've had for several years. The sound quality with the subwoofer is pretty amazing -- we do often use it to play music and it's a noticeable upgrade. Also the response rate with the old model had gotten somewhat laggy lately and this responds right away. The only minor improvement would be to keep the light up circle around the edge or elevate it slightly in the middle so that it is easier to tell when the device is actively listening/responding.,5,0.9571,Positive,92

675,I can only speak my truth on this one. I wasn't sure what to expect. All I know is that the echo plus that we purchased for our son sounded great on its own. However for someone that likes sound right in their face with definition. The echo plus wasn't enough. When I came across the echo studio I definitely had to see what it was about. Like all excitement I couldn't wait. Once delivered and after powering and connecting to our network. All I can say it was More than worth the wait. I've watched and read quite a few reviews on this particular device. Long story short none serve this product justice. With that being said nor will mine. This is going to be something that you'll definitely have to judge for yourself. Although let me say this in regards to price point sound quality and capability hands down beat some of the high-priced dollar setups that are out and available. Put it like this if you were to put one in each room along with two plus a sub in your living room there's no reason why you should miss a beat while moving throughout your home and in some cases even in your front or back yard just saying.,5,0.9706,Positive,213
676,"Great speaker, but I'm having problems connecting my TV to this studio echo throght Bluetooth, I had a echo plus and others and works perfect with this android tv, but the studio has issues with Bluetooth connection maybe will be fix with a firmware update.

If you love your Echo, you're really going to love this! We have plans to connect it to wireless speakers throughout the house, but even by itself, it fills the house with sound! Love it!! Unfortunately, the Alexa app makes using the Echo Studio a less than amazing experience. I can't believe how wonky and difficult the app is. Not user friendly and ruins the joy of simply creating a playlist or editing it. Have a question? You'll get caught in an endless loop of non-answers. I don't understand how such a beautiful product can have such an awful app. Alexa even misspelled the name of my playlist, and I can't even change it! If she misunderstands your music request, you will forever be looking at that mistake in the app with no way to delete it. I've asked how to delete, and it seems I can't. Stupid. Technology is great when it works. This app needs a total overhaul.",5,0.967,Positive,191
678,"This unit has excellent sound as a loudspeaker and it will fill open areas with nice music.

Our home has much Alexa enablement with firetv sticks, 8 Alexa echos and lighting. I mention this as this unit in two different rooms experienced confusion with an echo show picking up directions. We adjusted the configuration to make this work but i mention this as this seems to be an Amazon opportunity for teams to do better testing on products.

Primarily, i purchased this one over Bose for the intent of sound quality and Alexa integration. My only caution is on two small points. First, the unit lacks the low volume quality sound that my Bose units have. I am picky but this is comparable pricing to Bose and I can redirect my audio to my Bose at low volume and have a much more relaxing experience. Second, the unit lacks universal micro volume control. The volume jumps from too much to too little for some scenarios. Other than these two details, the unit will rock at mid to high volume with the best speakers.",4,0.9612,Positive,183

I was blown away with the Studio response that fills my cathedral living/dining and even kitchen area.

I had been playing two Echos that were paired with sub. After comparing the two setups I concluded that for my use. The Echos beat it hands down. Had I purchased two Studios and paired with the Echo Sub it may have been a different story, but the size of the Studio did not lend itself well in my opinion to purchasing two. Not a bad product, just not what I had hoped for.",3,0.8575,Positive,108
681,"We have been having trouble with our Sonos speakers staying connected lately and Alexa was never able to find them when we wanted to use them so I opted to get a Studio. Honestly, the Sonos gen 1 speakers sound better to me. Even after the room setup, which is a pain to re-trigger if you move the Studio to a different location, it still sounds fairly lifeless.

The mic has been discussed all over on various forums, it does not pick up nearly as well as our original Echo Dot. This was a swing and a miss for me. The Sonos speakers are acting better now with a recent update so I avoid using this for music listening. Mileage will vary depending on what you are looking for and expecting but I was hoping for more I suppose. If you want real sound, skip this and get a Sonos or decent bluetooth bookshelf speakers.

Also, our Alexa system recently lost one of our plug in lamp switches. Worked fine until last week. Not sure what they did at Amazon but why does every tech company assume we need software updates? It was working. I doubt this is directly related to the new Studio. Just odd it happened soon after installing and setting up an Alexa Studio.",3,-0.2806,Negative,217

Then, the base just wasn't enough for me even at full in EQ.
Thrid, and most importantly, there's just not enough volume coming out. Full blast is what I would expect for medium volume. Granted it would be a little better with 2 of them, but I'm just too disappointed to keep it. Sending back.",2,-0.3513,Negative,107

So if you have not cut the cord and are still using cable you are not able to access the full sound potential on that input.

Also, every time I woke the laptop up, the Echo shouted ""Now connected to ___ computer"" at full volume - super annoying. According to the support forums, this can't be turned off.

727,"I really wanted to like this, but I'm sick and tired of repeating myself to Alexa. It's like the Studio needs to wake up or something before it can respond. In perfect silence, I'll be right next to it, and ask it something, and nothing happens. I ask again in the same tone of voice, and then it works. Makes no sense. Happens all the time. It sits on the same quiet shelf as my previous Echo devices, but it doesn't hear nearly as well. For this reason, I like my 2nd Gen Echo Plus much better.",3,0.833,Positive,97
728,"I am only slightly impressed with the audio quality but, hey it didn't cost ""thousands"" either. When the volume is increased it is possible to detect a better quality sound.

729,"I LOVE THIS DEVICE. and I love that Amazon has done what no other company has done.....update the Audio streaming format so that you get better than CD quality. You can actual tell a cow bell is being used on a song, instead of it just sounding like a pot is being hit. I have not heard anything about Apple doing this (3D) yet and they started the whole music library bit. So a BIG thank you to Amazon for the 3D format. This Echo has the best speaker sound!! I would definitely buy another one.",5,0.9776,Positive,96
730,"I ordered this to take the place of a second gen Echo plus in the kitchen.
Pros
-increased volume
-better low end, especially at higher volumes
-better clarity compared to echo plus
-speaker firing positions fills room better
-3D audio is cool if limited.

Cons
-bulky relatively speaking
-fabric finish may not hold up in certain environments
-comparable speakers edge it out to my ear(Sonos 1)

All that being said I really enjoy this speaker and use it daily for music, news, pod casts, timers and find it to be very handy and enjoyable. Acoustically this is still an excellent speaker and I would recommend it especially if you’re already in the ecosystem.",5,0.9731,Positive,113
731,"This is not ready for the limelight as a serious home entertainment center speaker, and it’s not for the sound. This thing will NOT stay paired to any fire device. There is a huge amount of lag, even while both devices are on a gigabit network, right next to each other and the router. The Alexa app will report completely different wifi networks than what the devices are actually connected to, which is the most ridiculous problem, and gets the most frustrating “Cannot connect, make sure the devices are on the same network” error message. YEAH, THEY ARE. It’s been a huge nightmare, and I’m considering completely trashing the home theater setup. The optical input apparently doesn’t work for certain devices as well, so this has become the most expensive dedicated PS4 soundbar. Huge disappointment.

It will hear it, of course, but after you shout as loud as one can, and multiple times at that!

Just one word of caution I had these issues with playback. Do not use the Tidal integration piece it doesn't work and you will get errors like I can't find your music. So stick to Amazon music or Blutooth and you will be ok. I wish they would fix that but I can see why they wouldn't because it's the direct competitor to Amazon Music HD.,5,0.7982,Positive,94
734,"This is by far the best echo yet. It's nice to finally have some solid bass without adding a separate sub. I'm also very pleased that fact that the sound and vibrations from the bass don't travel through walls that much so I can listen to music at a decent volume in a room with the door closed and not get complaints from others in the house. And with sound that is immersive, rich, crisp, and clear. The John Williams 3D playlist is amazing.

We have ours in the same room (den) as a show 10 and have the show 10 control it. Basically we setup a room “den” in alexas app and put both devices in it. Then set the speaker for The room “den” to be the studio. So when I tell alexa via show 10 to play music it sends it to the studio.

The other problem I have is that the volume is not that loud on this speaker. The Klipsh sound bar for my tv sounds way better and has good volume.
I will use it for a while and then maybe try a different brand speaker in order to get better sound.
Over all, I do not think this speaker is a good value.",3,0.9623,Positive,95

Once you set it up you can adjust the bass, treble, etc. using your App. This makes a big difference!! Decent speaker that fills the house (open concept with 30ft ceilings). It throws sound in different directions that you would normally only find in a much more expensive speaker. Impressive little speaker, especially for the price.",5,0.9289,Positive,90

My mesh network doesn't have a lot of optimization features. I really don't want to have to set up a separate network just to get audio, but that looks like the only solution.",3,0.7469,Positive,105

751,"If you love to listen to crisp clear music with great clear high ends, moderate mid range and good clear bass.
You won't get any of that with Echo Studio.
It is a very boxy mono sound with limited equalizer adjustments.
It has the potential of better sound but you must subscribe to amazon's hd music service to get it.

These sound nice, while not as high end as Amazon would like to make you believe but still very nice, My wife and I are happy with the choice, as these are so much smaller than my stereo and speakers and with far less wires! All in all it was a good choice and a HUGE upgrade from the previous Echos.

755,This product is excellent in many respects. Everything most people would want to do with it it does very well. There are some caveats however: with Bluetooth the speaker volume is very low so you have to pretty much crank it up to max to stream audio from your devices to it. This means when you use Alexa it’s way too loud. There needs to be better control over various inputs as far as volume goes. Then the most disappointing: I wanted to use it for my television since it has optical audio in. I though great! Issue is that the lag time for the optical audio is ridiculous. You can’t watch movies or tv with it as the Audio source because of the delay. I’ve never seen a delay like this with optical audio and I am kind of irritated. If it’s paired with amazon’s products for streaming the software handles the delay but if you are using anything else you pretty much can’t use this for your television.,3,0.8206,Positive,170

I have this paired with a Fire TV Stick 4K to turn my TV into an Entertainment Center. I just ask ikt to play something from Amazon or Apple Music, and t does. The TV lights up yo show me what's playing, and when listening to Amazon Music, the lyrics appear so you can sing along! It's the best Echo ever for music!
I like this so much that I plan on ordering a second.",5,0.9622,Positive,98
757,The speaker is great but the EQ settings do not hold on unless the app that was used to set them is left on. This sucks because we have it in a slightly enclosed space and we found it sounded better with the bass turned down a bit but we lower it with the app and then when the app is shut off the setting goes back to normal. The setting to turn off the dreaded 3-D setting is remembered thank god... We contacted Amazon via email they blamed it on a glitchy app installation which is nonsense we tried it on an android phone and two iphones each time the EQ settings reverted to flat.,3,-0.7913,Negative,116

2. I linked my Apple Music and sometimes it just wouldn't play the music.
3. The multi-room thing doesn't work well. Some times only one Echo has sound and the other is just silent for a while.

We listen to everything from Chopin to Paul Desmond to Led Zeppelin to Liquid Stranger in this house. It’s all good. Highly recommended.",5,0.9537,Positive,75
786,"Wow! Amazon hit a home run with this device. The sound quality is simply amazing for a device of this size and price point. They were able to keep the cost reasonable which I think is a huge advantage for the Echo, because it sounds every bit as good or better than more expensive devices from competitors. I did purchase a subscription to Amazon Music, which I was hesitant about, but it really does pair perfectly with this device. Still amazed they can get such a big, filling sound out of a device this size. No regrets on this purchase.",5,0.9735,Positive,100
787,"Echo Studio recognizing voice commands is very poor compared to the other less expensive Echo models I use. The Echo Studio sound quality is good and exceeds my expectation for a speaker of its size. Unfortunately, there are several bug issues associated with use of Bluetooth speakers. Most often when I disconnect the Bluetooth speaker use of the internal speaker will not resume and if you speak to the echo its light blinks as if responding but there is no sound. Also sometimes when I disconnect the Bluetooth speaker the Echo Studio will send its sound to another Echo in another room. Ultimately I will need to restart the Echo Studio. None of these issues are present on my other Echo Devices. So I give 1 or 2 stars due too to high device cost verses frustration level.",2,-0.8358,Negative,138

I had monster speakers, turntables with belt drive and 20-lb platters, Akai reel-to-reel tape decks, sophisticated receivers....but, alas, still the hiss & pop of analog. Eventually digital got sound right and the question was how big did you want it? Now all I need is an Echo Studio. But, never satisfied, I'll likely succumb to adding another and the sub in the middle. It only took sixty years to reach perfection.",5,0.7545,Positive,79

So when I came across Amazon Studio, I thought I would give it a shot because the specs were just what I was looking for plus it has the added Alexa facility. My thinking was if I didn't like it I could easily return it (Amazon has the best returns policy). Now that I have had it for about two weeks, I don't think I will return it. I play on it from my PC as well as the smartphone, and I play from all kinds of sources - from my library on the PC, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube, you name it. Good stuff.",5,0.9753,Positive,133

I liked the Sonos 1 sound a bit better, but ease of set up and complete functionality has me keeping the Studio and sending back the Sonos. Once I get another Studio and the sub woofer I'll be done. Days of insisting on the best audio I could afford have migrated to really good sound and ease of dealing with technology.",4,0.9746,Positive,82
792,"Wow, sounds great! Extremely easy to set up and configure. It does everything Alexa is famous for and truly makes all music sources come alive. And when it is fed with a Dolby Atmos or Sony 360 tune, it almost defies words. Could it be magic? Utterly remarkable sound and a veritable bargain. Highly recommended for music lovers who wish to have an additional or primary sound source available for nearly unlimited titles. Absolutely love it!",5,0.9878,Positive,76
793,"The Echo Studio sounds is super for a speaker of this size. The Alexa usability is at best a 3.5 out of 5. The blue like it hard to see so it is hard to tell if Alexa heard a voice request or not. Also, i still have not been able to configure the unit as a HUB. Much better interaction with a TV would be appreciated. It is a large heavy speaker. At this point in time, I should have waited until the unit was a little more settled in",4,0.9407,Positive,91

I have two Studios with a sub, and I can't imagine how bad they'd sound with just one. The sun is pretty muffled without any real 'pop,' is more of a rumble than a hit.

There are so many issues with the voice commands and Amazon Music. Sometimes your playlists aren't found; songs cut off before they're over; songs and artists aren't found even when you're looking right at them in Amazon Music.

Customer service is a joke when it comes to their knowledge of the protect...they really don't know what they're talking about and it's highly frustrating.",2,0.8615,Positive,133
796,Very easy to set up. The sound quality is awesome! I think the price could be $100 cheaper but I am curious to see how it’s also a hub for smart devices. I haven’t quite figured that out yet but I’m glad I got it and I’m also glad I can make payments on it over six months.,5,0.9609,Positive,58
797,Not terrible. But for the cost I was expecting much more. Incredibly buggy with another echo device around. I’d ask a question in one room and have it answered in another device in a different room. Sound unexplainably stops working from time to time when watching Netflix or Prime video. Not much bass for music. Again this isn’t a terrible speaker but for the money you can find something better.,3,-0.1086,Negative,70
798,Honestly this speaker right here blows my mind this the quality of the sound is amazing and the bass is great I have the echo plus which is around 130 and this speaker is 200 and it blows the plus out of the water I’m currently using it as a sound bar for Dolby atmos and it’s perfect and for music it’s great .,5,0.9623,Positive,64

I think that the designer should consider on *Echo Studio #3 version"" If coming to the market.
***it's to put a *battery memory back up* so when you disconnect the power from the speaker
it wont loos the program it's in., and when you reconnect the speaker somewhere else we customers

801,"I've been very impressed with the sound quality from the Echo Studio. We really like music in our house and it does it all VERY well. If you were blindfolded, you'd have a hard time telling that it was just a single speaker. The highs are crisp and clear and the lows are deep and not boomy or distracting. Very good balance of sound and is plenty loud. The Alexa integration recognizes your request much better than other Alexa enabled devices we have had in the past, even when music is playing loudly. So far, we LOVE having this in our house and I'm very impressed with the sound quality, which was very important to me.",5,0.9821,Positive,116

Bose has NOTHING on this little sound system!",5,0.9117,Positive,77
803,This is far better then the first and second generation alexa speakers. Bought 2 to get the stereo sound! I now have 6 total and the sound is crisp throught out the house! These are not first generation or echo plus..... these are the studios that are bigger and far better.,5,0.7494,Positive,51
804,This echo is top shelf. Its a great price for what it is! With amazon music subscription the tunes just keep coming. The Highs Mids Lows are all perfect and you can tune it individually with echo app on your phone. I just bought my second one and connected it to the fire stick 4k and talk about superior sound for movies and tv. Im waiting for my echo sub to come in and i believe it all connected with each other will be the best you can get for the money hands down! Great job Amazon!,5,0.9701,Positive,97

I did have a couple little hiccups getting the smart lights to work, but was finally able to get everything connected.

That is really the final item missing from their lineup.",5,0.9658,Positive,74

BUT, these is no option for directly connecting output from Echo Studio into an external stereo system. The 3.5mm jack is strictly for input into Echo Studio. I run Amazon Unlimited HD/Ultra HD through a Sonus Connect device on another stereo system -- sounds great! I was hoping to go with the Echo Studio for this system, but not possible. The Echo Link is not an option either; its DAC is too limited and cannot process HD/Ultra HD. So I returned my Echo Studio and will bite the $350-$400 bullet for a Sonus Connect or Sonus Port. Expensive, but at least they work.",3,0.9066,Positive,133
810,"Amazon didn't disappoint with this speaker they gave you exactly what they stated simple yet good.
There are a few things that could make this speaker stand out from the rest.

811,I replaced my main music echo with one of these and wow what a difference. Adding the subwoofer really kicked up the low end and widened the sound field.

Sound is loud and crytal clear. to top of it all, Alexa is very impressive and very accurate. It can control also other smart connected home devices such as camera's lights and TV. Was able to control my Vestel TV using Alexa in my Echo Studio!

An excellent buy if you are looking into the Smart Home category.",5,0.9864,Positive,99
814,"I have the echo spot and the Alexa buds. Both ok products- not great - just good. However, I just received the Studio today and I love it! Very high quality sound, responsive Alexa and works seamlessly with the Alexa app. I have an Apple HomePod, and that has excellent sound quality. The Studio is pretty close to it. This is the best Alexa product out there right now. Very pleased so far...!
Update: Still love so bought a 2nd to stereo pair. Works perfectly and sounds amazing!",5,0.989,Positive,88
815,Unfortunately I’ve been living with this for a year. It very often does not hear us. it’s microphone is somehow not sensitive enough compared to our other Alexis. I believe there was a speaker out when we got it but I wasn’t sure the sound just did not seem very balanced but after about five months The sound quality kept deteriorating now the speakers are just raspy and some songs that seem to hit a certain frequency play so poorly we can’t even listen to them.,1,0.7906,Positive,86
816,"I""ve had the second generation Echo alexa for a few years. Music was why I bought it. Since then Echo's features have been expanded. Recently I found the new Studio. The best sound yet. We love it. There's a lot of you tube reviews you can watch. My only issue is the remote for the studio is not available. I was able to buy one for my older Echo, hoping it would work with the Studio. But no good.

The remote is really needed. I don't think they made a TV without a remote in 30 years. Hard to yell commands to alexa when you have the volume cranked up.

Other than that issue it's the best Echo Alexa music platform. Come on Amazon, get this issue resolved.",4,0.906,Positive,128
817,"I purchased this with plans to replace our Google Home Max as we are an Amazon Alexa home. Incorporating it into our home was easy and all of our smart devices work well with our setup compared with the problems we have with Google Home. However, when you compare both sound quality, base and volume/loudness, the Google Home Max blows the doors off the Studio. There is a dramatic difference when you put the two side by side. Considering the Studio is more expensive than the Max - I returned it the same day I received it. Very disappointed in this product.",2,0.3197,Positive,102
818,"Sound is pretty good for such a compact speaker system. The only thing I can say is in the instructions it states:
"" For best sound place at least 6 feet from any wall"". Well, that is most impractical for just about any room. Six feet from a wall is usually also six feet from any AC outlet. I guess if you can re-arrange the furniture to place the unit on an end table at the end of a couch, you could probably manage to meet this requirement. But other than that I would say it provides a good sound and is easy to install and is functional.",3,0.9313,Positive,108
819,"I would like to say that I was skeptical of this purchase after reading everything. But I am glad that I did, I am very happy with the Studio. The sound was great, the ability to use all of the echos in my house as an immersive sound experience is amazing. I have had no issues what so ever with the Studio. Set up was a dream, I was listening to my favorites with in 90 seconds of it being plugged in.",5,0.9831,Positive,82
820,It seems like my echo dot 3rd gen picks up my voice better and also is louder when responding. The echo studio has amazing sound quality while listening to music but when you ask Alexa something her response is not as loud as the 3rd gen dot. I wish they would do an update so you could set Alexa to respond at a high volume level of 9 or 10 and have music/sounds set to play at 8. That would be nice.,5,0.9194,Positive,82
821,I love the idea. Little tough to control the volume from Spotify I have to actually go into the Alexa app or talk to the speaker or walk to the speaker to click the button to control volume. Sometimes there’s a delay in the Alexa sub and the song from the speaker. For how big the speaker is I was expecting better sound from this especially with the sub. Sounds weird but the bass only really comes through when you have the volume low. The higher the sound is the less base there is. And the bass is not really good to begin with. The apple HomePod speakers has more base than the sub and Alexa speaker combined. The Alexa speaker is louder overall though just way less bass. Overall speaker quality doesn’t cut it. Don’t waste your money. I’ve never been so excited for a product yet so disappointed. Maybe someone else had a different experience,2,-0.9062,Negative,157
822,"The good:
Quality build and feel, good size, easy operation, Alexa integration including multi room music and sound quality except for voice reproduction.
The very, very bad:
No matter how I adjusted the sound, the voice reproduction was terrible. Always sounded like it was in concert hall mode and lacked the warmth and natural sound I desired for my type of music. I played the same music on my Echo Show 10"" and the voice sound was very much better. Although the Echo show 10"" does not fill the room like the studio speaker, it produces better sound overall.",3,0.9629,Positive,99
823,When I played the first song through this speaker my eyes widened in surprise. This larger version of the Echo puts out surprisingly good bass. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The Atmos speaker system gives good clear sound with the ability to adjust even mid tone levels. It's easy to set up and I can work my smart lights through it as well. I'm very happy with it and glad I purchased it.,5,0.9819,Positive,75

825,Excellent speaker just as good as a Boses (which I have). My daughter bought it for me as a gift and I am playing this more then my Bose with a Subwoofer on my computer. I am a Jazz fanatic (real Jazz not that smooth fake stuff) and It connects to my Amazon Prime music and sounds great. I no longer play my CDs just sit and tell Alexa to play a play list an artist or a specific album and enjoy.,5,0.9699,Positive,82
826,"Oh my God it sounds so much better than the Echo plus. It really fills up the room with a sound. I'm going to get another one so I can pair them up.
I think the microphone on my echo plus work better but maybe it's because the speaker is louder.

So my plan is to get another one and maybe get a subwoofer for Christmas. I also did the high definition quality through Amazon music and I can actually tell the difference.",5,0.6848,Positive,83
827,"The studio is a really nice speaker but it is still a small speaker. The sound quality at low volume is good but if turned up, it is ok at best.

The Studio really provides room-filling sound for an affordable price!",5,0.9346,Positive,71

I have had no issues at all. I tell it to play music on pandora or Spotify every day and it works great. Sounds great with movies too. I have considered getting the echo sub for added bass but it isn't really a necessity either because I have a full 5.1 home theater system in the living room if I really want to enjoy a movie.

I was dissappointed when I discovered that I could not set it up with the configuration I was seeking.

It's always a shot in the dark when I want to listen to Spotify. Sometimes the music plays and other times it's silent.

At this point I should have gotten a regular home theater speaker setup.,1,0.7061,Positive,112
838,"I was hoping for a superior sound quality from the Echo Studio, but I was disappointed when I listened for first time. Definitely an upgrade from the Echo Plus, but I wouldn't call it 'studio'. Another downside is the zero visibility of the alexa light indicator on top of the Echo if you are not watching over the level of the device. Lets say, if you are sitting and the Echo is your eye level, you will not be able to see the indicator lights. On the plus side, the included ZigBee hub makes this a worthy upgrade from the Echo Plus. I think a more fittingly name for the Studio would be 'Echo Plus II'. The 'studio' is a little misleading.",4,0.4569,Positive,122

851,"I’m going to have to agree with the most helpful review that this Echo really shines when you pair them. We enjoy the increased immersion when watching our TV and when playing video games. If I had to nitpick, I just wish that you can pair two speakers over optical. Instead you must split the optical signal, but that would make it just two speakers each running its own set of channels.",5,0.7715,Positive,72

But when I got the echo studio it blows everything else out of the water, the 3-D experience Is great, but I listen to a lot of classics which are not digitalized, and they sound great on the echo studio as well.

I am very pleased with this purchase, and would recommend it highly!!

Great sound for a great price!!",5,0.9913,Positive,89
853,The Echo Studio is incredibly awesome. The music fills the room fantastically. I feel like I’m at a concert because the sound surrounds you. I love to hear my music loud and the sound quality is incredible. I love having the ability to request any song I want to listen to with Alexa fulfilling it immediately w/my Amazon Music HD subscription. This is my first Alexa product and I’m very satisfied.,5,0.9718,Positive,71
854,"Richer, deeper bass make this a great speaker for music. The integration of Amazon Music Ultra HD lets this speaker shine. It has a bigger footprint than the Echo Plus it replaced. I wish the treble were a bit more pronounced, however. As for whole house Echo integration, it doesn't always recognize that I'm speaking to it rather than the Echo in the dining room one room over. That makes it a little frustrating, but we have 6 in the house now, so sometimes the wrong device responds. Otherwise, if it were the only device, it definitely sounds better than all others.",4,0.7906,Positive,102

I kept going back and forth on buying it mainly between do I need it or do I want it, well I figured I want it and need it, the sound quality is amazing in my apartment. I have been playing more music now that I am stuck at home cleaning and it's perfect, the music quality is better than my car system. I just wish we could stream other music via bluetooth. Hopefully amazon fixes that with an update. I am glad I bought this and my next purchase will be the subwoofer.",5,0.975,Positive,111
857,"I was initially very impressed with the studio. After many months of music enjoyment it developed an annoying software glitch making it unlistenable. It will randomly get very loud and distorted.

I would have to reduce the volume manually which would create another problem. The next song that was played would be too low to hear anywhere in the house. I would then increase the volume and go about my business untill the process would present itself again and again and again.

Thinking I had a faulty studio I requested a replacement from Amazon and they promptly sent one out. It too developed the same problem and now is used as a place holder for one of our dots. The dots operate flawlessly.

I do not recommend you buy a studio at this time. The dot works without issue in my home. It is a shame because when the studio works the sound is far better than the dot.",1,-0.1232,Negative,159
858,This is a great sounding speaker with exceptional voice recognition. I also have an Apple HomePod and I think the sound quality on the HomePod is marginally more refined than the Echo Studio. The Studio seems to be a bit too heavy on the bass tones but it’s still a great way to fill a large volume of space with a ton of sound. Perhaps some way to tune the equalization would make it perfect.,5,0.9354,Positive,75
859,"This unit sounds great on its own. So good, I bought another one. When adding to speaker groups with other Echo units, it does not work too well. Each unit gets confused on what is playing through the speakers, and most of the functionality of ""Echo, what is this song"" or ""Echo, turn the volume to 6"" do not work. So I find myself saying ""Echo, play my music on all speakers at volume 5"" and it's hit or miss. If anyone knows how to correct this, please let me know.",4,0.8736,Positive,91

I highly recommend these based on the price/quality ratio. It's a steal.",5,0.9606,Positive,74
864,"Alexa, where have you been all of our lives? LOL My husband and I love our echo / Alexa. The sound quality is amazing for such a small product.

It is very convient and sounds great! High quality!",5,0.9198,Positive,71

So, unless you subscribe to Music Unlimited, you won’t be able to access Amazon music with it. The “music everywhere” feature that allows you to play all Echo’s at once sort of comes and goes.

869,"I was impressed at 1st, but have been without any sound system/speakers besides my aging Logitech 5.1 PC speakers. I gradually became frustraited by the inability to customize the sound to the music I was listening to. The basic ""Bass, Midrange, and Treble"" just dosen't cut it. Amazon needs to introduce a full sound equalizer on the next release. The bass was very good, the mids were meh, and the treble was very weak. Given this I have decided to return my Studio. I was at a big box store today and heard the Apple HomePod - despite being a bit smaller the sound was exponentially better.",3,0.3278,Positive,107

I can tell Alexa to turn on the living room lights before I get home at night. I can be lazy and turn on the lights when I am reading! It is so fun. I play the “Question of the Day”, and music for studying and I can order from Amazon(such a dangerous feature). I love it and am setting up Alexa to make phone calls with a voice command. I am new to this Echo studio stuff, but I like it. And I can turn off the microphone so Alexa does not write down everything that is said.",5,0.8791,Positive,141

Lots of times, an Alexa unit (typically a Dot) in another room will hear and answer. We call this unit our special needs Alexa. We’re pretty happy with the Alexa system overall- and when this unit “hears”, it responds fine. For the money, maybe another Echo would have been as good a fit.",3,0.9493,Positive,103

I went through a number of tech experts at Amazon, only to be transferred un-knowingly to a non-Amazon support, who started to wreak havoc on my Mac i.e deleting important personal files, movies. This tech support would not help till I agreed to pay them $189.00 and to subscribe to their IT support.

If you have a subscription to a service like amazon music unlimited or tidal or any other service that has 3D audio tracks, it sounds even cooler!

The bass is really punchy, I guess this was also made keeping in mind some people might use this as a subwoofer (?) so that’s a plus too.

All in all, highly recommended!",5,0.9399,Positive,104

880,The quality of sound is great if you’re streaming music from your computer or phone. The room sending auto acoustics seems to work well. Problem is I bought it (and new 4K firetv sticks) to create home theater and it doesn’t work for crap as many have mentioned. Often comes up with “having audio issues” and suggests you lower the audio quality. Lower the quality makes no difference and found cuts in and out. Some suggest this common problem is caused by network issues but placement makes no difference and all the other streaming devices have no issues. It also takes sometimes a minute for the studio to acknowledge you’re playing from fire and that it needs to start audio.,2,-0.8674,Negative,120
881,"The Echo Studio works very well with the Alexa platform. Great integration and voice recognition. Sonically it is very close to my Apple Home Pod... at a much lower price. Compared side by side to the Home Pod, the Studio has much better bass depth and response than the Home Pod making it much more “room filling.” Clarity in the high and middle frequency range on some vocals is sometimes not quite as crisp as the Home Pod, but I’ll take the minor trade off and give a thumbs up for the great bass response and room filling sound.",5,0.9048,Positive,99

I have 2 of these paired as a home theater with my Firestick 4k. When they work, they are quite impressive. However they frequently drop the connection and lose sound. I have done everything Amazon support has recommended, including spending more $$ and replacing a fairly new 4k Firestick. Amazon refuses to correct this problem and it feels like they've kicked the issue down the road to avoid either replacing or returning them for a refund.

Should they fix the issue, there's no question that these would be 5 star worthy. However they are not ready for prime-time",1,0.4867,Positive,125

However, I eventually noticed that the sound was not syncing with the lips while viewing TV. There is no setting available to tune lip syncing. This device connects to the TV through bluetooth (which causes a sound delay) or through an optic cable (which will not carry the Dolby Atmos effect). An HDMI connection would have been ideal, but it doesn't have one. As a music speaker I think it works well, and Alexa is very responsive, but not capable of substituting a sound bar.

I have tried to take just the studio to a friends house to show how much I liked it and have been unsuccessful in getting it to play which definitely doesn’t help in the selling point.

I have it set up for optical out from my TV into a splitter and connected to both Echo studios like one of the review video shows. But for some reason on some days, one studio loses connection.

It also adjusts to the size of the room it’s in, and can be moved anywhere in that room with great sound. It does need to be plugged in. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is there is a delay in using Bluetooth to connect the speaker with my iPhone and Mac.",4,0.8957,Positive,111

I have heard from other reviews that the Echo studio as a pair without the sub are good. That’s true. But when you add the subwoofer, you really get the added “ umph” that compares to Sono or HEOS. The speakers pair easily. The subwoofer is a little harder but it connects with a little bit of fiddling. The other benefit is that you can run the pair in the same room for stereo or put one of them in another room for mono playback.

ALEXA can hear every word said, even over a high music volume level. The only way to not be heard is you must turn off the microphone, just a touch of the microphone on/off button for total privacy. You will not need a manual to get started, just plug it in and meet ALEXA. You must have a manual to learn all you can do. They should of included a manual in the box, but they do not !

Shortfall I see so far is when playing my own music, the volume level dips very low. This wasn’t so with my echo. Also the Alexa app freezes when using the studio when trying to skip a song or play over. I don’t know if that has anything to do with the speaker.
But I like the quality of the sound of this speaker.",4,0.734,Positive,72

The sound it produces is great and fills the room with the bass which is a nice plus compared to the Echo Plus.

However, I definitely cannot say the same about the lower end of the frequency spectrum--the bass is weak!

If your technical team could only correct this issue via an OTA update, either by directing more watts to the subwoofer, modifying its frequency range, or simply raising the volume of the sound coming from the 5.25 inch woofer. The technical part of how to do it is obviously the perview of the engineers.

You can’t keep the tv sound on at the same time as the echo studio because it echos. Super disappointing buy. I have spent soooo much money on Amazon Alexa products and am really disappointed with this. I would return but I threw away the box immediately because I had faith in their products.,1,0.3079,Positive,80

Two, it's bluetooth or optical in for the inputs and it doesn't come with an optical in cable.
Third, if you change inputs to bluetooth, you can't get back to the optical in to use it as a soundbar without either unplugging and plugging back in the cable or resetting the whole device. I heard that was supposed to change, but they've been saying that for quite some time.",3,0.765,Positive,122

Overall, a definite improvement !",3,0.9758,Positive,72

If I had it in a bedroom it would be fine. In my living room I want more. I'm hoping that this issue will be updated at some point.

Anyway, Alexa was not that smart. I keep having to have adjust volume between tracks. So I have to keep asking Alexa to either raise the volume or lower it. If anyone knows how to remedy this I will change my rating. Apart from the speaker, Alexa still needs a lot of work. I have her hooked up to my fire stick 4k and she still can't carry out some pretty basics commands on the apps I loaded, e.g. YouTube. I'm going to keep this only because I may have a party and it is loud. I may one day buy some JBL's again but for now I'll keep the studio.",3,0.5864,Positive,146
1029,Wow !! Amazing sound. I like that you can pair it with another set of speakers (echo only) but not that the two speakers need to be identical. I guess it makes sense. Without pairing to other speakers it sounds amazing. It can be added to a speaker group with dissimilar echo devices. Adds a tremendous deep rich sound with crisp base. Not muddy or over done on the lows. Very satisfying.,5,0.9678,Positive,72
1030,I ordered this as the main source of music for the whole family that would live in my kitchen. I ordered the Sonos one first in that speaker was all high range and middle.

I have large vaulted ceilings in the first-floor area, and it provides not just room-filling sound, but HOUSE filling sound. Took it to my finished basement where ceilings are lower and the design is like a speakeasy type bar/lounge. It sounds so good I am ditching my other audio options and relegating them to just the media room. The way it adjusts to the room is amazing and if I had known it was so good...

1067,echo sudio is not compatable with fire tv i bought 1 year ago. i feel amazon should have warned me of this before i purchased it since they have a record. i wanted to use as a supplemental speaker and this is not possible. i also feel the sound is not a major improvement over original so what is the point. disappointed,2,-0.3812,Negative,62

Movies sound just like it does in the theater. Every different sound coming from a different part of the room. Fire Sstivk works great and has very fast processing. The bass is Incredibly good Especially when the Dolby Atmos is being used in a Movie. For the size of these Studio Speakers they are a real bargain.

I tried changing up the sound settings but the music consistently sounded flat regardless of what I did. The vocals of songs sound much clearer and punchier on the echo plus than they do on the studio.

1150,This unit is everything I was looking for and more. The sound quality is exactly what I thought it would be. I use it to connect my firestick 4K so I can get my TV through it.

1151,"I use Echo Studio as a controller for smart home devices, a standalone Internet radio speaker, and a speaker to pair with my laptop for better sound quality. The sound quality is quite good - except for the lag-time with the laptop. A little research shows this problem to be fairly universal, and explained by Amazon as being a fact about Bluetooth, a ""laggy protocol."" In other words, Amazon chose a ""laggy"" protocol, and has no solution for it.

The closest thing I've found to a solution so far is to stop the video, unpair Echo from the laptop, pair up again, then re-start the video. Not great.",3,0.4427,Positive,108
1152,Warranty good for 12 months. Product stopped working after 13 months. Like it was programmed to last just long enough. We didn’t use it very frequently becuase the sub always needed to be reconnected in the app. It did sound decent when it worked. More trouble than it was worth half the time.,1,0.3415,Positive,53

1158,"The fact that I can't create groupings of speakers the way I want - is ridiculous , That Alexa goes offline or sleep at random is unacceptable - Still learning how to get over some of these hurtles - but for the price - these issues should have been resolved prior to going to market.

1160,"The sound is definitely way better than other Echo devices, and fills our kitchen with great sound. The voice recognition -seems- like it doesn’t always operate quite as well as the other echo devices but it very well could be just because I have the volume up a lot louder a lot and maybe base is interfering. Otherwise, it’s an Echo with a subwoofer and we like it a lot.",4,0.9206,Positive,70

1173,"Terrific sound - which was my main purpose for purchase. I wanted a ""stereo"" quality sound and was torn between this and a well-known much more pricey option. I am so glad I went with the Studio. Not to mention, it's just a fun item to have! We regularly use to play games, which there are many to choose from",5,0.8992,Positive,60

The biggest problem is the Alexa app .I was on the phone with Eddie from Amazon fire tv for over 6hrs to get fire stick 4k to hook up with studio ,we tried every thing . I used the Alexa app on my I phone could not get it to work. The next day Eddie called me back and I had a Samsung tablet which I. installed Alexa app on it and I connected the two the first time I tried. they need to fix this on the I phone Alexa app.I would like thank the fire tv assistant Eddie for his efforts to correct the problem . He was awesome .",4,0.83,Positive,122

1178,I have been a dedicated Echo purchaser (have bought 6 for my home and office and given them as gifts). When the studio came out I was among the first to own...but for whatever reason when you give a command echo studio repeats the command but nothing happens. It’s highly frustrating - especially at the price when compared to the other models that do work well. Maybe I got a Dud instead of an Alexa.,1,-0.4835,Negative,75
1179,"The sound is clear and well balance, is easy to set up, but is not as loud as I expected. I put it in my home office which is pretty small and even there the ECHO STUDIO doesn’t feel loud at all. If you like your music loud like me, then look for another speaker.",3,0.9337,Positive,55
1180,"Only 4 stars because of BT interface would have been 5 otherwise. The only thing I don’t like is the Bluetooth interface. What ever you connect via BT I.e laptop or phone, you will have 2 separate volume controls that are independent of each other. One on your device and one on the echo. On my Bose and Harman/Kardon units once you pair a phone or laptop if you turn the volume up on the device it also turns the volume up on the Bose and vis versa.",4,0.3612,Positive,88

Since purchasing I've had to unplug and plug back in for Alexa to respond a couple of times (something I've never had to do with any previous Echoes or dots), so that cost it a star. Still, it's a much better music experience than your ordinary Alexa provides.",4,0.6222,Positive,71
1182,"I didn't expect such a huge unit, with such amazing sound. I purchased this for outside use. The sound is awesome being outside.

The only issue is, when you have the unit cranked up, good luck with Siri hearing your commands. Other than that, I love this.",4,0.9652,Positive,47
1183,"When I read the description of this product I was very impressed, But although good it isn't much better than my original Alexa.",4,0.7084,Positive,23
1184,This speaker is amazing. Good bass plus clarity. Alexa is not that intelligent though. Pair it through your phones Bluetooth to play your already purchased music with having to pay for a subscription. Once paired via Bluetooth you can command Alexa to play your purchase Apple Music!,4,0.8913,Positive,47
1185,I felt this device (echo studio) was very limited and only gave rich sound through the amazon music app. I have a fire stick and a fire cube and four echo dots. For the price i paid i was expecting rich sound with using the fire cube which i felt was limited to adding additional speakers. Also the echo studio's maximum volume was not as loud as i expected! I am very happy with the four echo dots i purchased and they preform well for the price. Will be returning this item (echo studio) ! For 200 this speaker is useless!,2,0.5826,Positive,101

1187,"This unit has lousy sound. Very tinny sound with no base, The regular echos that I use have much better sound especially in the base area.

I highly recommend buying this product.",5,0.9701,Positive,38
1190,"For the size and weight of this device I had high expectations. When we started it up for the first time and we heard the little jingle, I was impressed but that's where it stopped. All other typical functions work as expected but listening to any music no matter the genre is disappointing. My echo plus sounded better. I thought maybe it had an equalizer but I couldn't find one. I'm gonna keep it a few more days and if I can't improve the quality of the sound, then the echo plus is a better option for me for the money.",4,-0.031,Neutral,101
1191,Loyal Alexa customer I have all the device’s. This one however I sat next to my new 60 inch Samsung Tv within one week the tv went out. The tech who came out said it was the magnet in this that had blacked half my screen out. Maybe Amazon should post a warning ⚠️ about this!!!!!,1,0.5526,Positive,56
1192,"I purchased the Echo Studio for some better sound/volume than the Echo Dot that I have. It does provide that for sure! The sound is much fuller than the Dot with way more bass, maybe even a bit too much as it seems bass heavy. The Alexa part works pretty well but it seems like Alexa has a harder time picking up my voice than with the Dot, but maybe because of the higher volumes? It also seems better able to connect and stay connected to my WIFI than the Dot, so that's a plus. Overall I'm satisfied with the speaker but there could be some improvements made, like being able to set-up the sound via an equalizer to customize it more to my liking.",4,0.9788,Positive,125
1193,"After a few days, I returned this. I had no trouble pairing with my Fire Stick and the HD music sounded pretty good. However, it would take about 30 seconds for the Studio sound to come on when watching a show and sometimes it cut in and out. Sound wasn’t as dynamic as I had hoped.",3,0.8425,Positive,56
1194,So far so good. It’s a tad on the bulky side but the trade off in space for sound is worth it. It really does fill the room. It functions as it should as an Alexa product. It has all the features of an Echo plus which I already own. This is great addition to my Alexa family of products.,5,0.8894,Positive,60
1195,"For a standalone with all over speaker integration, great sound!!! However I purchased mine under 150, now at about 200 bucks, sure does make a difference and keeps me from buying a second... otherwise the sound quality with out tweaks is superb! You decide.",5,0.913,Positive,44
1196,"Its great, awesome actually!
Although it was supposed to come with free Hue light bulbs, it didn't but thats on Amazon, never heard back about them. But the Echo Studio is incredible. Great Awsome sound, I've been using it alot more than my Denon X3500 lately.

Get it, put on some Pink Floyd and let sounds fill your room!",5,0.9787,Positive,92
1197,"The echo speaker is absolutely incredible. Sound quality fills the room and setup took seconds. Definitely recommend dropping the extra $100 into their top-of-line ""studio"" version.

I returned the speaker, great sound, but not good enough to forget about the volume control. I bought an Apple HomePod instead.",3,-0.5425,Negative,47
1200,"The sound is great. I swapped my Echo Plus with the Studio in the kitchen and the difference is well, hearing is believing. The Studio handles the large room much better. The only reason I gave a 4 star for voice recognition is that sometimes Alexa doesn't respond and requests have to be repeated. Never happened with the Plus or the other Echos scattered throughout the house. It could be because I crank up the tunes when no one is around and Alexa wants to keep on rockin'. I want another one but don't have anymore rooms to put it in.",5,0.5574,Positive,101
1201,Synchronous paring between two Studios and a 4K TV Stick - can control each with the other.

The directional speakers make this one of the best options for home theater system without the wiring. I have heard full Sonos systems and they are impressive but for the price I do not believe there is a better option than what the Echo Studio's offer. I have it all streamed from my Fire TV cube, which used to be hooked in to my soundbar via HDMI.

1210,Solid build provides a good sound at all levels. I was pleased with my 3 other Alexa/Echo devices. The Studio is worth the extra cost to increase the richness of the music. It is our primary source of music playback in our 1000 sq. ft. open floor plan LR/DR/Ki,5,0.9153,Positive,49
1211,Great speaker all around. The only issue I see is you can’t see the “thinking ring” on the top of the unit. If your eye level with the speaker you’ll have no idea that it is listening to you. Other then that it adds a good amount of sound to a room.,4,0.765,Positive,52
1212,The Echo studio is an amazing device the sound quality and base that comes out of this thing has me shocked every single time I use it. Voice recognition works for me even when I’m rocking out.

1215,The design is fairly bad. It’s very difficult to see the light on the unit to tell if it’s hearing your commands. We have the Studio in the same exact space as the old gen 1 Echo used to be and we almost have to shout sometimes for it to register.,2,-0.7425,Negative,51
1216,"This speaker is really excellent. It has nice bass sounds, adapts to the space it's in, and Amazon support is quick and good. Only thing I don't know is how giftable it is, really. That all depends really on what you want to spend for a gift.",5,0.9459,Positive,47
1217,"Good quality sound, works well as a link to Alexa, but unusable as a Bluetooth speaker. Whenever the Bluetooth connection drops and reconnects automatically (which happens naturally every few hours), the Studio will yell out at top volume ""NOW CONNECTED TO <computer name>"". This cannot be disabled, cannot be turned down, and ignores 'do not disturb' mode. Users have been complaining to Amazon for a year now, but there has been no response from Support.

This is annoying enough during the day, but when it happens at 3am, loud enough to be heard from every room in the house, it makes this absolutely unusable.",1,0.2469,Positive,104

The sound is very clear and compared to my gen 2 echo, the studio is in another league for richness and clarity.

Had to send it back. Amazon required I go to an Amazon drop off center to return and issued a gift card instead of crediting my card as requested.

I purchased her the echo studio for Christmas and shoot I love this speaker. It has a lot of bass and for a device that only goes up to 10 this speaker is loud. I have a Harman Kardon speaker and this one is right on point with mines.,5,-0.1154,Negative,78
1236,"This speaker is built high quality, it's heavy, it's beefy, it sounds like butter, beats like honey, total bang for the buck, best deal in town, homerun, no brainer. You won't regret it 👍

Plus, the Alexa thing is pretty fin cool. She sounds hot, lol.",5,0.9488,Positive,46
1237,The sound quality is excellent. I am extremely happy with my purchase.,5,0.8268,Positive,12
1238,"The sound quality was quite disappointing. After all the reviews, I was expecting a step up from my Echo+, it wasn't. My Echo+ has better bass. I really thought about returning the Echo Studio but decided to keep it. The hype isn't reality, this thing is average.",3,-0.0763,Negative,47
1239,It took a couple of days for the Echo to settle in -- we needed to find a good place for it. Once we did it sounds great and Alexa finds most music we ask for -- using apps I forgot I had in some cases. All in all an excellent experience (after a couple of weeks) and the price is super.,5,0.9393,Positive,62
1240,"This speaker is the Bomb! Excellent sound, easy set up! No issues whatsoever! Love it! Another great Echo device!",5,0.9646,Positive,19
1241,"My son tested it head to head against his Apple Home Pod (the one that's about the same size) and they came up on par with each other. Minor differences here and there, but in the end it's really about which eco-system you want to be in.",5,0.1154,Positive,47
1242,My only problem is I love bass maybe more then the rest. Bose speakers do that the best for me. So after reading a out the studio that's want I was expecting but it's not on the same bass level. With that said it's really a good buy it has bass just not enough for me. It sounds really good I would buy another one if something happens to the one I have.,4,0.9195,Positive,73
1243,"What a sound this has!! When you put the Echo Studio in any place in your home it will adapt the sound to where it is in your home, so if it is in a small area, it will adapt, in a bigger area it will adapt, we have used this to play hard rock, country, slow any type of music it sounds great, the bass is awesome as well.",5,0.9167,Positive,70
1244,"I am a huge Alexa Echo fan, period. And I really enjoy the Echo Studio's sound quality. That said, I was hoping for a more powerful sound. In fact, I've been on a quest to upgrade the sound - I do like my music to be loud and clear in the house - and was certain that this going to do the trick. It's gotten me closer, but, still not there . . . . .",4,0.8588,Positive,76
1245,I am replacing my entire stereo system with Echo speakers and this provides a good base to start with. I don't even miss the 5 channels of my former system as the studio has great presence and some music has the 3d effect also. I love being able to listen to the same music as I go from room to room. Ordered an Echo sub today also to pair with it.,4,0.9126,Positive,71
1246,"I have come to rely on this for my lighting. Between my Echo and my Kindle, I control most of the lights in the house. The sound is quite good. I enjoy the Serius app on this machine. If you have some discretionary money, spend it here.",4,0.7688,Positive,47
1247,"A GREAT disappointment. Truly one of the WORST purchases in my life. Within 6 months the Bluetooth & WiFi connectivity stopped working. Can’t even use the speaker wired with an audio cable. The app is STUPID and useless.

Complete waste of money. Can’t wait until Apple comes out with a similar product because EVERYTHING Apple just works flawlessly.",1,-0.8816,Negative,58
1248,"When I received this unit I was surprised by its weight. It is definitely solid, which is one reason the audio sounds quite good, with a lot of depth as well as clear upper tones. No, it may not have the range and register of a high-end system, but it plays very well within the Echo family. Installing and adding to my Alexa app was also very easy ... easier, in fact, than setting my my Echo Dots. I set it in a corner of my living room so it is out of sight, but it still fills the entire room with a rich and balanced sound.",5,0.9774,Positive,107
1249,"The speaker sounds good, but it will only connect to one Amazon Music account, so only the person who purchased the speaker can stream high-quality audio. Anyone else who wants to use the speaker can either ask Alexa to play something or use a different streaming service. Spotify was the only other service I found that would cast music to the Echo Studio, all others had to go through Alexa.

If you like shouting orders at Alexa and hoping she finds the right music, this speaker is fine. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",2,0.9115,Positive,93
1250,Got this while it was on sale and I’m going to grab another one the next time it’s on sale. I’m a Apple addict but I can’t spend $350 on a speaker especially when this is as good if not better. I’m still trying to figure out how to connect the speaker to a smaller echo for the home theater but other than that this speaker has been great!,5,0.8263,Positive,69
1251,The only complaint I have is it could be a little louder. I use it in a workshop and would like it to be a little louder.,4,0.0772,Positive,27
1252,"As an owner of the original Echo, I’ve added multiple iterations including the Tap. I bought this for the room where I primarily listen to music with high expectations. Those expectations were exceeded! It sounds great with all types of music. Thankfully, I have not experienced the voice recognition issues that others have mentioned. So far, it’s been awesome!",5,0.9311,Positive,59
1253,"This things sounds amazing! Blew my mind.. I read and heard all the reviews and once I heard it in person , I was blown away... had to order a second one so I can have the whole Atmos effect! Couldn’t be happier! Adding the subwoofer next",5,0.8433,Positive,47
1254,"Sound is great! Could use a bit more bass, but otherwise sounds good. The only issue I have, which is likely an app issue is playing music in a group. For some reason the studio will disconnect mid song. No issues if its the only device playing tho.",5,0.807,Positive,48
1255,"Amazed at how good this speaker sounds! Paired it with an amazon remote so now I can control it from anywhere in the house, the sound really does fill the room! It’s easy to move, I find myself taking it from room to room because I love how it sounds! Alexa can understand me better than other echoes.",5,0.9564,Positive,58
1256,"Set up in under 5 minutes. At first the sound was odd and flat. After playing different types of music it adjusted itself to my room, and blew us all away. I would give it six stars if someone came out with an equalizer app and the ability to direct the spatial stereo per the music manually.",5,0.2023,Positive,57
1257,"I really didn't understand what the appeal of Alexa was until I bought this for upstairs music. Paired with Amazon Music this is just remarkable. In addition to music, I now have three devices tied to it and I love the convenience.",5,0.8591,Positive,42
1258,"I've been using the Echo devices for years; always looking to upgrade. So when the Echo Studio went on sale, I purchased it quickly. The sound quality is very good and I like that it self-calibrates. Is it an improvement over the Echo Plus? Yes. But I wouldn't say it's night and day. The bass could be more pronounced which is what I was expecting. Perhaps that will be addressed in the next generation.",4,0.6904,Positive,74
1259,Beautiful rich sound and setup completely automated with Alexa app. We knew when we turned it on and it tested the room acoustics (which sounded like the Dolby Sound promo in movie theaters) that we were in for a treat. Absolutely incredible!,5,0.9184,Positive,42
1260,"Love the sound. In addition to listening to music (streamed or bluetoothed), I also use it as a ""soundbar"" for my TV. There are two issues though... the first is that the Echo Studio can not hear you when the volume is turned way up (understandable, but it should have come with at least a simple dedicated remote), the second is that several times per week it stops working altogether and has to be unplugged to be restarted... not real good for a device that is intended to be on 24/7.",3,0.38,Positive,91
1261,"It works well and this unit certainly has more bass but they have no business using the word ""studio"" in it's name. The mid range is just eh and the high range is almost nonexistent. (yes I used the app to makes changes, didn't help)",3,-0.0784,Negative,45
1262,"Great sounding echo, the best by far. It sounds good with standard Amazon Music but comes to life with Amazon Music HD. The only thing so far is that I wish there were more options / adjustments on the equalizer than just three channels. (Bass, Middle, Treble)",5,0.9011,Positive,47
1263,"There are so many things that become available but perhaps the best has been the ability to just ask for the music and whatever I ask for comes with just my suggestion. Makes that completely easy to constantly have the music at the volume I enjoy.

Everything else like turning on and off lights, changing the temperature and listening for the doorbell are a great help as well. Getting the weather, news and virtually all information I ask for is wonderful",5,0.9909,Positive,81
1264,Living with the Echo Studio in my home office the past couple of months has been a great pleasure. Between the ability to stream radio and Amazon HD Music it's a perfect background companion. (Does not have to be played loud to sound good.),5,0.9628,Positive,44
1265,This studio sounds amazing. I have 2 studios paired with the echo sub and it rocks. The voice recognition works very good even when the volume is turned up loud. Would definitely recommend getting it if your on the fence. Won't be disappointed.,5,0.9293,Positive,43
1266,It's an Amazon product so of course it integrates well - occasionally after power outage has an issue reconnecting to the wifi - sound is by far the best offered in any in the echo line - not quite as good as my amp driven infinity speakers,4,0.6584,Positive,47
1267,I’m not using this as much as I thought I would. It was easy to set up mostly but I’m still having trouble with linking m certain lightbulbs. Sound quality is pretty good but I’d like a little bit more bass. I’m sure when I do more integration and I get used to using it it’ll be fine.,5,0.9516,Positive,58
1268,"Bought two Echo Studios and they sound great paired together and in our everywhere group. Also paired with Fire TV as home theater but when paired with TV it disconnects the internal TV volume.
Waiting for next gen Echo Sub to add to the pair of Echo Studios!",4,0.2828,Positive,48
1269,"This is probably one of my all time favorite things I have purchased for myself. It sounds superb. For the price, I don't know how I could have done any better.
Listening to my all time favorite singer, Gregory Alan Isakov, is a pure joy with the Echo Studio!",5,0.9523,Positive,49
1270,"This was my first Echo product. I say “Echo” because when I would call her Alexa my spouse looks at me like I moved an ex girlfriend back to our home. Calling her Echo works ok except when certain Geico commercials come on the TV. The Echo 3D Studio will not replace your nice surround sound system BUT the sound is plenty sufficient for most entertaining scenarios. Sounds as good as any speaker, that size, you could pair with your phone. Alexa (uh.... Echo) seems to respond quicker with this unit. My Echo Dot is a tad slower. Easy to set up. Highly recommend.",4,0.9578,Positive,104
1271,For over $200 it was what I mostly expected. There is room for improvement. Also if your home theater receiver has Bluetooth it gives this product more versatility and improvement in sound quality (depending on your sound system).,5,0.7402,Positive,38
1272,"It’s like hearing your favorite music for the first time. I was hesitant because of the price, but it’s worth it.",5,0.5574,Positive,21

Sound quality is fantastic. I would definitely recommend if your looking for alexa capability with good sound. As a added bonus it controls Phillips hue bulbs no need for the hue hub.",5,0.9618,Positive,43
1274,"The sound is very good. Pretty good base with addition of Echo Sub - but only after a period of self-adjustment. I got better base a day after pairing with two Echo Studios for stereo sound. Alexa has some difficulty understanding song/artist requests. She often responds to my request by playing something else. I have Amazon Music Ultra and created my own playlists - “My Music” within the Amazon Music account - and Alexa will too often respond to my request to play a playlist of my own creation in “My Music” by playing instead an Amazon Music curated playlist. All in all, though, I am enjoying.",4,0.9789,Positive,107
1275,Great audio and easy setup. The only gripe is trying to locate which songs in the Amazon music library are recorded in Ultra HD. Haven’t used the smart home hub functionality yet but I’ll update this review once completed.,5,0.6908,Positive,39
1276,"After a Echo Dot speaker blew out, I decided to try the Echo Studio. I was NOT disappointed. This small device packs a powerful room filling sound for our favorite music. Thank you Amazon for continually improving your offerings. This ne is a keeper!",5,0.928,Positive,44
1277,"This was a nice addition to my echo collection. It is a great speaker, and a fully functioning echo. I use it for listening to music plus I have it connected to my fire tv via bluetooth and to regular tv via an optical toslink.",5,0.6705,Positive,45
1278,"I'm primarily listening to music or streaming radio on this device during the day and it is an endless source of frustration. The sound is perfectly fine, even great for my purposes. No complaints there. The connectivity, on the other hand, is terrible. Bluetooth is so inconsistent that it's unusable. Playing Spotify through this speaker is only slightly more consistent, but if you want to switch to the next song, that can be waaay to much to ask of this device. My little old first gen Echo Dot was a champ at this in comparison. Why is this technology getting worse?",2,0.7209,Positive,101
1279,Good quality sound at high levels. Equilizer on phone for Echo doesn't work. Electrical interruptions short out the Studio. Hard to get back on,3,0.5801,Positive,24
1280,"Greatest speaker for its price point and it’s abilities. My one year old loves sitting in front of it and letting the sound of the music just get wrapped around her, which is the best way I can describe the sound and experience of the speaker. I listen to a mix of things as well and have not had a terrible experience with any. Even familiar songs so much better on here. Also, for those of you that have it, definitely play the 3D songs on Amazon Music on the Echo Studio!",5,0.9799,Positive,92
1281,"Picked mine up on Prime day. Looks good and has sounded great everywhere I have placed it. It won't be the loudest speaker out there, but excellent value at this price point. I put it in my living room and have had it up to 65% and was loud without being too loud. We could still converse and enjoy the music.",5,0.9513,Positive,61
1282,"Wow sounds great
Love it
Fills the room
Ultimate",5,0.9201,Positive,9

1284,"Not a single complaint, well from me at least, my neighbors downstairs say otherwise haha.

The sound quality is amazing (after the update) with spacial enhancement. The bass is great, I use it as a home theater for my Samsung TV, and honestly if I had a house, I would buy 3 more. Don't let the negative reviews fool you this is a great buy, best speaker I have ever owned, especially for the price.",5,0.9783,Positive,75
1285,"This is not a HIFI stereo but it sound pretty darn good ..perhaps even better if you had two of them but I am pretty happy with this one, and it is in my honest opinion way better than my regular Echo (1st gen).
I will add the subwoofer for a deeper bass and will update then.",5,0.9857,Positive,57
1286,Great sound for the money. The size is ok but it is a tad heavy. Not a bookshelf speaker. I was in the market for a speaker and thinking of getting a Apple HomePod. It’s a bit pricey and only plays Apple Music. The echo studio plays it all and was $100 less. Great buy. I’m very satisfied.,5,0.9552,Positive,58
1287,"It's a Godsend for music lovers. great bass. turns on my tv, my lamp(I'm short and if I'm comfortable in my spot under covers I don't have to reach over and out to turn it on/off) or get out of covers all snug and warm. ;-)",5,0.9547,Positive,46

Would most assuredly never buy again or recommend.",3,0.659,Positive,32

1290,This echo studio sounds great. I stream music from several sources. I have mine connected to an echo sub. I am not a sound snub. This speaker is not perfect but if you want something that sounds great at a good price buy this,5,0.9212,Positive,44
1291,"I am super happy with my Echo Studio. It sound looks and performs amazing. Music comes alive, Movies are better and awesome. Works perfect with my fire tv cube 4k and paired with a Echo Sub brings thunder to my room. Worth every penny.",5,0.9756,Positive,44
1292,"Very good sound quality for such a small unit. Cannot compete against audiophile systems, but let’s be realistic, it’s not meant to. Much better than the standard echo / echo plus by a long shot and can easily fill a large area with sound crisp and clear. Well worth the price and I contemplate buying additional to replace normal echo units for other areas where I like to listen to music.",5,0.9623,Positive,71
1293,"- Like the more base tone in this unit
- Size is good for putting in most places in the home or patio
- Easy for my spouse to set up and configure
- Liked so well purchased another unit, so have the great sound quality in two rooms",5,0.9532,Positive,49

1295,"Using this speaker in my Master bedroom with a square footage of 800 square feet. The quality of sound that fills the room is very impressive.

I'd like to see them come out with outdoor waterproof versions of these to be pair for my courtyard.",5,0.7485,Positive,58
1296,"I loved my version one Echo but decided to expand and upgrade. The sound from this blows me away. It’s clear and has great bass. I was considering the subwoofer but it’s not needed.
Amazon hit it out of the park with this one.",5,0.9284,Positive,44
1297,"Hi fidelity? Not really. Somewhat better sound than a standard echo, but to claim it is ""hi-fidelity"" in my opinion is stretching the truth quite a bit. If I had heard it before I bought it, I wouldn't have spent the money.",3,0.3077,Positive,42
1298,"The speaker sounds great, and when connecting it to the fire tv stick, it added the surround affect like larger systems. Another good thing is that its able to hear you pretty well at higher volumes. The build quality seems great so far, but time will tell.... in the meantime, i love it!",5,0.9417,Positive,53
1299,"Sound is better than a traditional Echo, but still not great. I am disappointed in the sound quality. I've realized that spending the same amount of money on some dedicated speakers that you can plug into a standard Echo produces much better sound.",3,0.0539,Positive,43
1300,"I love it! I really don't know why I waited so long to get one, but I finally did and I'm totally in love with it. I'm still in the process of figuring out just what Alexa can help me with so it will keep me entertained for a long time.",5,0.9532,Positive,51
1301,"This speaker is even better than I hoped it would be. There is no other single speaker that produces the stereo separation that this speaker does...and it's down-firing woofer gives it a meaty sound that so many of these speakers lack.

1303,Tons of great reviews on here so I bought two...needless to say they are very underwhelming. Not that loud. Not much punch to them. Cuts out sometimes. Volume drops sometimes. They interrupt each other when speaking to them. Equalizer isn’t great and impossible to tell if the setting “stick” since in the app they always look reset. They are pretty much just blah. Not sure what is better at this price point though...so I will probably keep them. Added the echo sub too....that little thing is wayyyyy too loud for their speakers. Even with bass set to minimum.,3,0.8533,Positive,98

1305,I really enjoy this speaker. The way it fills the room is very surprising. It analyzes the acoustics when you first set it up and then it fills the room and sounds like way more than it's actual size. Very glad I purchased this.,5,0.8929,Positive,44
1306,"I have to hear it by myself... stunning crystal clear sound. If you read this, stop reading reviews and try it. Ah, if you want to pair it with another speaker for HOME TEATHER only with another (2x) Echo Studio is your solution. If you paired Echo Studio with Echo dots, it works only for music or multi-room music and it sounds awesome.",5,0.8555,Positive,63

1317,Great speaker for its price point. I bought it during prime day and for what I paid it is def worth it.

I didn’t quite notice the 360 degree sound but overall I was satisfied for what I paid.,4,0.7717,Positive,62
1318,Found it very difficult to work and set up with our FireCube. Its so big that it looked terrible setting in our family room. Doesn't blend in and hide. Just too big for that. The sound quality was not as good as Bose Solo 5. We returned after one week trying it.,3,-0.8401,Negative,52
1319,The speaker is great a bit to “deep” for my taste but it can’t be adjusted. To create any sound effects such as stereo definitely 2 would be best but it’s price is steep. Overall it is powerful and does the job well.,4,0.9678,Positive,43
1320,I love it. I have had And Alexa since the prototype. I have the first generation or the original that was only given to limited people. I loved her then and she’s only improving. I am so happy with this new generation. She has a nice sound quality that adheres to whatever room or space you are in. And the thing I like about this new model is that when I say Alexa even if the volume is superhigh she’s always listening so that she can stop and listen to what I have to say. Well done Amazon.,5,0.9717,Positive,98
1321,Really like the sound. Better than I imagined. Really powerful speaker.,5,0.831,Positive,11
1322,It’s pretty good. But not a great audio device. It’s my first Alexa product and it’s pretty neat and all that. So the Alexa features are cool. There is some lag time between my phone and the device as far as turning volume up and down which bothers me because often when you want to turn down the music there is a reason for it. Maybe it’s just me. I absolutely love Bose products - and know that Not everyone agrees with me on that.

Love it. Well worth the $200 for someone who loves music and having Alexa right there.,5,0.9723,Positive,50
1329,"Music is crystal clear and sounds great.

Pairing with a firecube is mixed. The sound is great, but it's impossible to set at a level where you can hear dialog and the movies sound doesn't blow you out if the room.

There is a vast sound difference between dialog and music or effects in the same movie.",3,0.7096,Positive,57
1330,"I originally wrote a favorable review of these, but it's hard to like them when any music you play on them eventually stops even when I didn't tell it to, or even when music is set to repeat. A regular old stereo can do that, but Amazon has a big problem if they can't make their devices at least stay connected.",5,0.5267,Positive,61
1331,This is loud! I upgraded from an echo dot. There is a night and day comparison between them. I can listen to full music with zero speaker crack. Very easy to set up. I migrated the dot to a bedroom. Very happy with this speaker edition.,5,0.8165,Positive,46

1336,"Great speaker. I too was skeptical about this ""3D Audio"" but it does work. Really start to hear music notes and instruments not previously heard on music I listen to regularly.

Sounds great and loud enough, but I was hoping for bone-shattering sound",4,0.8316,Positive,19
1338,"Overall, the sound quality is pleasant. This product suffers from 2 issues in my opinion. The sound volume could be more robust. I just can't crank it as loud as I would like. When set up in a multi room environment, the volume gets out of sync and it's difficult to reset to normal.

More 3d music content from Amazon music would be nice. This speaker does sound impressive when playing a 3d music source, albeit it's wimpy volume.",3,0.8622,Positive,79

1342,"When it works, the sound is rally great. However, the connection with FireTV drops twice a month and you need to redo the theater setup all over again. The ""smart"" utilization/skills are still very limited. Please note that you will not be able to use when you miracast your training on your Peloton bike (only the sound but not the sound +tv) . If you want to play with new technologies, it's a really fun speaker. If you only want a speaker to work every time, then there's cheaper/better options.",3,0.9258,Positive,90

1344,Great sound. Very loud,5,0.6249,Positive,4
1345,I will say i was not all that impressed with the sound quality until I upgraded to amazon music HD. There was a noticeable difference following the upgrade This is our first alexa product and we are finding it much more useful than we thought we would. Highly recommend this if you’re looking for an alexa product with room filling sound.,5,0.6288,Positive,61

1347,"Despite the intriguing design, I found the sound quality lacking. The Alexa features did not make up for sound quality for me.

1348,"About a month ago, I bought Amazon’s top-of-the-line Echo device, the Echo Studio. And I have to say, I am impressed! If you subscribe to their HD service then you have access to their entire library including a wide selection of music in HD, Ultra HD, and 3D. The presence, clarity, and bass response from such a small device is remarkable. To listen to something like Puccini’s “Nessun dorma” or Queen’s “Who Wants to Live Forever” is a religious experience!",5,0.9097,Positive,80
1349,"We have always loved the echo for playing music in different areas of the house but got tired of moving her around. When we decided to invest in a second one, the studio sounded perfect for our musical needs. We were not disappointed! She sounds better than the system in our brand new truck.",5,0.9104,Positive,54
1350,Far superior sound and volume to regular echos. I have it also hooked up to the tv and a firecube and it significantly improves the experience with a virtual surround sound system in compatible movies and shows.,5,0.743,Positive,37

1354,The sound from this device was even better than expected. So nice I purchased a second one and paired it to have stereo sound in my bedroom and connected to my Fire TV Stick. Rich lows and crisp highs. Set up fairly easy and takes a little while. Overall very impressive for the price.,5,0.9247,Positive,54
1355,So far we love the two studios we purchased. We set them on either side of the couch and they fill the house with incredible sound. The bass is impressive for how small they are. We’re thinking about picking up a few more.,5,0.83,Positive,43
1356,"This speaker produces great sound- I don’t think it could be beat at this price point. I love it. I am glad we upgraded for our living room, it makes a huge difference!
I was raised by a dad obsessed with speaker sound. We had tube amps, the huge speaker wire and thousands of dollars worth of equipment- all that stuff. The sound quality from this little speaker does not really compare to that and I am not sure it “fills the room,” but it is better than anything I have had in my adult life. I highly recommend.",5,0.9423,Positive,99
1357,I really like this Alexa. She sounds great . It has very good bass and crisp highs. I was thinking about buying the additional subwoofer but its really not needed unless I want to rattle the walls. I love the sleeping sounds. The ocean waves are most relaxing and help me fall asleep.,5,0.9701,Positive,53

1359,"I have been very happy with my new echo studio system. I purchased two studios and the subwoofer. It make a great stereo system, with two stereo separation and deep bass.

Finally got working and sounds great.",5,0.802,Positive,51

I'd previously had two (2nd gen) Echo Pluses (I think same as the current gen Echo) in a stereo pair with an Echo Sub, and I replaced that with the two Echo Studios. I'm not an audiophile, but to my untrained ears, it sounds much better than the Echo Pluses. I'm very pleased with the sound. Although some reviews said that the microphone isn't as good as the Echo, and that Alexa sometimes doesn't hear you, I have not encountered this problem.",5,0.3276,Positive,104

It has a lot of difficulty actually hearing people speak, such that I have to repeat myself several times or, especially for the women in the house, it never gets what they say right even after training.

It does the job of an Echo fine when it does work, and the sound quality is better than other echos, but I don't think it's worth the price I paid for it all together.",3,-0.0897,Negative,93
1366,This is a great value. Provides great sound for the price. I use it in my dining room and fills the space nicely. This is no high end audiophile speaker but at the $200 price point I think it's hard to beat.,5,0.6757,Positive,42
1367,"Great product by Amazon! The sound quality of this device for the price especially is excellent, I did alot of research to decide this smart speaker over the sonos 1, plus I have plans for an Alexa powered smart home in the future for lighting my gaming room and this was a necessary addition for sound 🙏",5,0.9422,Positive,57
1368,Will you really actually read what I say let’s put it to the test what I loved everything what I disliked I’ll wait for Echo studio to point out where hopefully you’ll put lights on the button so you can see when you’re reaching for them just like the echo thermostat which has a motion sensors to light up so I can see what I’m doing. Just a little thought.,5,0.802,Positive,70

It's rather annoying. Can't hear it when the music is volume LVL 5 or more, but below that... We will be returning/exchanging hers.",3,0.402,Positive,52
1372,I bought this because Alexa is just so easy to use and you. The sound is fine If you like you like the way Bose speakers sound. I personally like how Ultimate Ears sound better. More of a balanced bottom mid range and treble...if you like more of a bass sound /bottom end than this most likely isn't your speaker.,4,0.9472,Positive,60
1373,"Love my Alexa. I was hesitant at first to purchase one. But I needed music to help me through this pandemic. Alexa sound is perfect!! I'm not sure if I'm getting complete use, but when a favorite song comes on, it lifts my spirit. Pricey, but hopefully will be used for a long time. NOT happy about the 15.00/month service so I am not getting it. Can only afford so much. Wish there weren't ""add ons"" to everything!!",5,0.9638,Positive,78

1377,"This product works great with your Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, with the 3D upgrade. It sounds best with the available 3D music. With all the other music, I found I had to turn up the volume more to get a better quality.",5,0.9169,Positive,42
1378,"Sound is great. Alexa’s ai needs more work but that is to be expected considering technology is ever growing. Integration is its downfall. Does not work well with existing Apple and google programs, and you can’t use the device as a Bluetooth speaker!",4,0.3962,Positive,43
1379,"I purchased this echo to put outside by the pool and it works great!! The sounds are very clean and clear, and Alexa is able to hear us talk to it even when the kids are splashing about. I would highly recommend this item.",5,0.9236,Positive,44

I bought one Echo Studio and it was okay. Then I decided to buy the second one a day later for the Stereo Pair. Worst decision and waste of Money! I can't listen to Spotify at all. A song will play and ten seconds later it drops and I have to hit play again. Such a huge inconvenience for anyone who just wanted to listen to their Spotify playlist. Just might end up returning both of them and Buying the Sonos One with Alexa as well.",1,-0.1511,Negative,92
1384,Through much fanfare I was very excited about this product. I purchased two of them to make a stereo pair for my fire cube TV and echo sub. After two minutes both speakers stop working and all I hear is the echo sub. Even restarting the television and the echo cube nothing seems to fix this issue. Unplugging the units and powering him back up still no affect. I hope this is a update fix in the future. At this point I am just very frustrated.,1,-0.5994,Negative,86
1385,This is an awesome device but if anyone can answer this question get close To your studio and pick a song that's 3-D Do you hear a buzzing or hissing noise when ever it plays anything for instance play 7 ring by ariana grande's when the audio starts then stops In between you start hearing it Better if herd with higher volume,4,0.8779,Positive,62
1386,This Echo Studio doesn't sound horrible but it also doesn't sound much better than my Echo gen 1. The subwoofer component is nice but I don't think there is much value in this model as a stand alone unit at $170-$200.,3,0.4795,Positive,41
1387,Unbelievably great. A whole new way of listening to music,5,0.659,Positive,10
1388,If you don't already use Amazon music do not purchase this product. It is nothing but a constant ad machine pushing you to sign up and once you do it continues with more ads to upgrade to the better quality audio membership. Pairing with my echo sub is a nice touch but for the cost of both you're better off getting a system from an actual audio company,1,0.903,Positive,68

1390,Amazon’s Alexa Studio model is certainly a much improved device over previous devices. The fidelity of all sorts of music is enhanced to the point that it’s beginning to sound like what was originally produced by the respective artists. While it’s a step in the right direction there is still plenty of room for improvement with the software and equalization schemes.,5,0.9153,Positive,61
1391,Coupled with music subscription and it is great. Full sound. Looks really nice. Love the integration with other smart devices. Does not work great with TV as there is a lag between video and sound.,5,0.865,Positive,35
1392,Overall good sound quality. I thought they would play louder though. The one negative is it seems I have to speak louder for Alexa to respond. These are replacing 3rd generation Echo Dots and Alexa responds to those from quite far away.,4,0.1531,Positive,42
1393,"When my echo broke I decided to buy the apple home pod. I have many apple products so it was a no brainer. I hated it! It's fussy, doesn't connect multiple phones in the house and set up wasn't easy. The echo studio is much easier to connect and the sound is superb. It's also $100 cheaper.",5,-0.6121,Negative,57

1396,"Its cool but this is not a 'speaker' if you just simply wanna play some musics, you can not connect through bluetooth so it means you cant play the musics on your phone, yes it will connect to you apple music or Spotify but it doesn't play it through your phone, you can not control your music on your phone without using alexa app, personal I like to pause my music or control the volume using my phone.

One problem is with Alexa this in general. When I try to set up groups and I have to change the location of the speaker. It doesn’t seem to allow me to do that. It is very convoluted. I’ve given up on setting up groups. Amazon really needs to fix this. It should be pretty simple.",2,0.5501,Positive,74

I highly recommend you use this service to maximize it’s full potential. Probably sounds just as amazing with optical audio in. I can only imagine what 2 linked together would sound like. This should cost twice as much, (and probably does to Amazon). I highly recommend this device, you will NOT be disappointed.",5,0.9796,Positive,75

1407,"The availability to connect to the phone is intermittent. Volume control works also only works occasionally. As a device for music this does not work well. As an Alexa device it works very well, but you don't need to spend anywhere near the price tag to get this functionality with other low fidelity devices. I'd stick with a low cost Alexa and separate speaker system. It is unfortunate, as I was hoping I could get what was promised and have both.",3,-0.2641,Negative,81
1408,"The sound quality is very good for the cost. The set up was relatively easy and the voice recognition works well. I was under the impression it would work only based on my voice.

1414,The sound is awesome but the interface is lacking. Alexa only allows volume control 1-10. You can not say mute without turning the volume to 1. You can not adjust the volume with the Alexa app. Maybe I just have not downloaded the correct app or skill. I looked but did not see one for the echo studio. I also bought an optical cable which does allow tv over the echo studio but it does not interact as well as I hoped. I also like that it’s a hub and is suppose to work without the internet but I have not tested it yet. Hope it is a hub for all my echo devices,4,0.9213,Positive,114

1421,"I got this to use as a speaker for music, control my smart home and be a sound bar. Unfortunately if you play music on it then wanna use it as a sound bar you have to unplug the device then plug it back in. For the price I would expect this to be seamless",5,0.4019,Positive,55

1424,I first purchased the Echo Dot then a colleague of mine suggested I buy Echo Studio. This speaker has some amazing sound. The louder I turned up the volume the better the sound. This booger puts out 3D sound that enables you here the song in studio quality. I just might get another one.,5,0.7717,Positive,54
1425,Got the Studio during the Prime Day sale and sure wish I had purchased two or three of them. Sound quality is excellent. Will be getting another one soon and will pair with the one I have now.,5,0.8271,Positive,38

The only sound system that compares is klipch with 1..k watts Macintosh amp.

Yeah, been that like long. I’m telling ya, 2 of these baby tubs is fantastic - paired of course. If just one of you enjoy you them like i do I’d be happy, sure, i can afford more but honestly I don’t need my studio monitor headphones any more, yes, really!!",5,0.9678,Positive,86
1427,"Excellent sound quality, really above and beyond the standard Echo or Echo dots. I have mine set up in a living room, with two echo dots at the other end of the room. The dots serve as satellite/surround speakers; the Studio really brings out the deep bass and clear highs. It's like having an audiophile type speaker on a budget. Very happy with this.",5,0.9152,Positive,64
1428,"If you are hoping to play Spotify on this, the app won’t allow you to link your account through Alexa App. The only way to play your Spotify is by using the Bluetooth. That means you can’t use Alexa voice recognition to play your songs.

If you guys emable youtubemusoc integration this product will be the best smart music system.",4,0.9001,Positive,29

1431,I like it but the microphone doesn’t work as well as the dot. It’s in the living room and probably 20 feet away from the kitchen dot. I often have to repeat instruction to the studio and sometimes when I do it gets picked up by the dot in the kitchen instead. Always had a great Alexa experience but If I’d started with this studio I would have never continued on because it’s frustrating to repeat things frequently to the studio.,3,0.7351,Positive,81
1432,"Got this one hoping Alexa could hear us better, but our gen 2 dot has better voice recognition and it's really frustrating to have spent so much on something and it not be at least better than the old cheap version. The sound quality of the speakers is great though.",3,0.9171,Positive,50
1433,"I use this speaker now in addition to my surround sound system. I like the surround sound system better although sometimes I just want to hear music immediately without going through all of the steps to turn on the system. The Echo Studio has a very good quality, deep clear sound which I can turn on in a matter of seconds to hear my favorite music (Amazon and Apple) in my living room and other rooms if needed (I have 4 other echo devices so being able to hear everywhere is sweet. I also like the small size and looks. Hard to go wrong at this price.",5,0.9459,Positive,107
1434,Setup was easy and sound is excellent. Looks nice on my coffee table.,5,0.8555,Positive,13
1435,Alexa is a game changer for me. I tell her to play some of my favorite music and call people on my contact list and she does. My favorite part is when she plays for me rain and thunder on loop mode all night just like I like it . It’s very calming for me and helps me relax after a hard day of work. She’s a must buy...,5,0.9661,Positive,69
1436,Oh my goodness this thing thumps!!!! The sound this speaker gives is leaps and bounds above anything offered by Echo speakers to date. Pair this with a 4k fire stick to get incredible surround sound out of this one speaker. Highly recommended.,5,0.5942,Positive,42
1437,"Got two paired with an echo sub. The sound is significantly different with the pair and sub - impressive! Along with HD subscription from Amazon music - Period Classical music with channels by composer - Nikolaus Harnoncourt, William Christie, Karl Richter, etc... - sounds magnificent!",5,0.8585,Positive,45
1438,The sound quality is superb. But I feel the voice recognition was better on my original gen 1 Echo. And it's strange that there isn't a remote any longer.,4,0.7992,Positive,29
1439,Overall this is a nice product. The sound quality is a little lacking for a speaker this size. I ended up putting it in my place of work in my office. It is a nice upgrade over the Dot I was using at work.,4,0.6808,Positive,44
1440,Absolutely sounds amazing. Worth every penny!,5,0.7604,Positive,6

1442,"I was disappointed at the sound quality, the echo studio has room sensing technology and 1 additional speaker over the regular echo. With the technology and extra speaker the studio, should easily outperform an echo 3rd gen (that’s 1/2 the price). It didn’t. 😕",2,-0.4588,Negative,44
1443,Excellent sound quality and it was very easy to set up. The mic pics up Alexa requests from the next room.,5,0.7841,Positive,21

1445,"I give 5 stars because it a great speaker, it can play high quality music and pair with your firestick as a theater system although extremely small lag in the voice (corrected in lip sync in my tv) I would check and compare with other new speakers.",5,0.5888,Positive,47
1446,Received this as a Christmas gift. We have several Echo devices in the house and this one by far exceeds the sound quality of all others. Just perfect!,5,0.784,Positive,28
1447,"I was looking at lots of more expensive speakers to put in my bar room. I went to a local Best Buy to listen to different speaker. The Studio blew me away, especially for the price. Didn't buy it there of course, got from Amazon.",5,0.7096,Positive,45
1448,I have had this over a year with daily use I easily have it play 6 plus hours of music a day. This is a fantastic speaker and by far one of the best Amazon speakers. It's not bulky and it has great sound,5,0.9545,Positive,44
1449,The Echo Studio adds a good deal of bass response to Echo line. It sounds full and rich for such as small speaker. Highly recommended if you are looking for a fine sounding Echo device.,5,0.8553,Positive,35
1450,"Love the ease of use of this new product! Is it an audiophile’s hi-fidelity product? No. But the sound is pretty amazing from a speaker with this small of a footprint. We have a very open concept house and it is able to fill the space. Try it out, you have nothing to lose.",5,0.9519,Positive,54
1451,"Not sure why but we keep losing connection and we’ve had our internet and WiFi checked. She’s just stops playing, mid song. Otherwise, we love it. I started with one, because of the price but I’m planning to add more to my studio to get the full effect.",4,0.4971,Positive,48
1452,Sounds great and does what it’s designed to do. Incredible sound quality,5,0.6249,Positive,12

1455,"The Studio constantly cuts out and can’t stay connected more than 15 minutes while playing music or audio. I have tried multiple networks and locations, still no difference.

But I don’t liked one thing that is I use Android and iOS devices and without Alexa app in Android, Bluetooth get connected easily for streaming music but from iOS,Bluetooth in echo studio never connected connected even with Alexa app set up too.Bluetooth name never shows in iOS. May be I need to have monthly subscription with premium.",5,0.8271,Positive,66
1457,"Very good sound quality when it works, but way too unreliable. I have been using Echo products for a few years and this one is less reliable than any of the others that I own. I need to unplug it and “restart” about twice each week. I also had to go through a process of removing the home theater group and the recreating it to get music to play. It randomly stops responding, or sometimes the light ring indicates that it is working, but there is no sound.",2,0.1272,Positive,88
1458,I researched a lot before buying the Echo Studio. I don't regret the purchase because we are an Alexa household and I think it's the best option but the sound quality is not what I expected it to be.,4,0.505,Positive,39
1459,"The Echo Studio has nice full, rich sound, with full bass and excellent volume. I must get another though, because the only thing missing is stereo. I can't have music without stereo.",5,0.836,Positive,32
1460,"Great sound, Easy setup, looking forward to making my Wink obsolete and having this be the home hub. Sound is amazing definitely multiple steps up from the plus. I had to move pictures off the shelf because the base was vibrating them enough to move.",5,0.9062,Positive,45
1461,I was blown away with the sound! I also like that I can be blasting music and say Alexa without screaming and she hears me no issues. With the Echo I had to scream at her to wake up.,5,-0.1301,Negative,39
1462,"Was on sale for $169, I think. For the price, it is excellent and deserves 5 stars. Sound has full rich bass, but a little thin in the mid and highs. If I paid $50 more, I think I would have been disappointed, but at this price my kitchen music is good.",5,0.5187,Positive,52
1463,It has amazing room filling sound that can honestly be heard through the entire house! The bass on this is enough to feel in the floor on higher volumes as well and even at higher volumes the sound is sharp and clear!,5,0.9018,Positive,42
1464,Sounds was nothing special -- I chose to replace with an echo dot and hard wire to two Harmon speakers I already had but did not like using with the app from Harmon -- now I control them with echo dot and they sound great.,2,0.4864,Positive,45
1465,"This ""little"" speaker sounds great. I have tried it alone, as well as paired with the sub, and both options sound better than my sound bar. The kids all love it, and can't wait to take it outside by the pool in the summer.",5,0.9008,Positive,44
1466,"I love the clarity and the bass I can install 2 Studio speakers in my home and submerse it with sound. This is a good buy. I believe it will also decease in price, it will be an even better buy.",5,0.9136,Positive,41
1467,Love love love the sound and it pairs with my Alexa enable TV in the bedroom for nice sound while watching TV or listening to Music. Alexa is easy to wake up. Perfect this over the surround sound I had set up previously.,5,0.9719,Positive,43
1468,Get a pair for great full sound. And Alexa is a great companion to the already convenient speaker package,5,0.8481,Positive,19
1469,"A single echo can be used for blue tooth streaming, but not two echo's paired in stereo, or three with sub. Amazon needs to do a software upgrade so you can have that and stream your files to it. Works fine with amazon music and sirius, but it appears that amazon wants to keep you on amazon music, and not allow you to stream your files to a three speaker system that cost me 600 dollars. That is not fair, please upgrade the software.",4,0.3643,Positive,84

Update from a few weeks later: honestly if I could give this negative stars I would. This product is such a nightmare to make work. Volume is a no go for the twitch app, which blows my mind since that’s another Amazon product. This thing sucks beyond belief, avoid at all costs",2,-0.7632,Negative,90

1476,I was sure I was going to like the Echo Studio but I really love it. I synched it with my TV and it it’s like I’m in a movie theatre. My music collection never sounded so good! Worth the price. Highly recommended,5,0.9741,Positive,43
1477,"Have a problem with ""Song ID On"". Play stops after one song when it's on. Tech support was arrogant and did not call me back when he said he would. They identified a software problem, but three or four weeks later - no fix. Otherwise, I love it!",4,0.4102,Positive,48
1478,Home run by Amazon. These speakers are amazing with powerful bass and perfect highs. Using it for outdoor theater and inside my home office. Setup in theater mode paired with a Fire Stick 4K and works flawlessly.,5,0.886,Positive,37

1480,Nothing to dislike. Looks nice. Music sounds great. Voice recognition is outstanding - it recognizes everything you ask. It even has a dry sense of humor. Plan to get another one for the basement.,5,0.9347,Positive,34
1481,"These speakers are pretty awesome. The sound is great. My only complaint is you can’t wirelessly connect to other media devices besides the fire cube, firestick or Amazon’s own services on these devices. If that’s not an issue for you I highly recommend getting two of these and an echo sub.",5,0.8908,Positive,51

1485,"Sound was fine slightly above average for a $200 speaker. The Alexa integration works spot on, she will recognize my voice even over loud tunes playing.

However the marketing claims are slightly over hyped on this. The sound stage is pretty mono. If you are in a small room, and sitting in the sweet spot you get a decent stereo effect. However for most use cases treat this as a very high quality single point audio source",4,0.8948,Positive,77
1486,"Amazing smart speaker. Picked it up for $30.00 off the reg price. It was a replace fir my 1sr gen echo. The sound quality is unbelievable. Read the online review and they were all positive, which made me purchase one.",5,0.8979,Positive,40
1487,Wanted to use as “sound bar” with TV and as Alexa. Connected speaker to TV with optical cable and works pretty good with TV speaker muted. The external input gets Alexa confused at times when switching uses. Also sound does not come from middle of tv like a sound bar does so it can seem a little odd that the voices are coming from the side when people are talking in the middle of the tv screen.,4,0.6478,Positive,77
1488,Why would amazon make a product that is not compatible with their previous echo devices. This is why apple is always ahead when it comes to technology. So dumb! Most people live in homes with multiple rooms. They probably are looking for a system that is compatible with their other Alexa devices or stereos. Common sense.,1,-0.5904,Negative,56

1491,"Volume can change as different song are selected, that is not good. I thought the machine was suppose to be constantly adjusting to the way I had set it up. Of course the sound is not the quality of my home stereo system, but it is much easier to access songs.Sometimes it plays some weird versions of the same song several musicians have recorded therefore I need to know the version I want. Also it would be nice to know if I can set up various favorites lists and if so, how to do it. Overall, its fun to play and I enjoy it.",4,0.9754,Positive,104

1510,Simple instructions to follow in setting it up. I especially enjoy playing music on it and the quality of the speakers are unbelievable. I have just begun to use a few of its many features.

What I will say is that placement is key for great performance. Placing in the center of the wall is ideal. I originally placed mine somewhat close to a corner and didn’t hear it’s full potential.",5,0.953,Positive,56
1515,I bought this specifically for the sound quality and it has lived up to the hype 100%. I use it in my new home office and it has been a great addition. When I have a few minutes to listen to music during the day it really fills the room with sound. I was a bit skeptical that it could tune itself to the room but it really seems to have done just that. Plus it has all the great Alexa features you want.,5,0.8402,Positive,84
1516,I upgraded from the Echo 2nd generations to these. The sound quality is definitely better however music with a lot of symbols are lost. Even if you turn off the stereo enhancement feature it’s a little better. But it defeats the purpose of the clarity and depth. So I would leave it on. There were some minor tweets but with the help of Amazon’s Tech support my issue was solved quickly. Overall I would recommend them but pair two of them with the Echo sub.,3,0.9419,Positive,85
1517,I really like the studio cause the sound is so clear. It’s a little challenging to set it up. Once it’s set up it’s great. I’ve used this in the living room and the backyard. The only this is I wish the speakers had more bass. I’ve purchased the Alexa sub and am waiting for it. I have two paired up. Pairing was pretty easy and sound great together. I would have given 5 stars had they had more bass and set up would have been a bit easier.,4,0.9783,Positive,89

1575,I actually like it very much.. I was disappointed in the sound. I was hoping more of a stereo sound. I am thinking I may of been thinking of the sound of the subwolfer for more base.

1646,This thing is amazing. It is a good bit bigger than I expected but after hearing the amount of sound it puts out I know why.

We love this speaker.",5,0.9571,Positive,18
1760,This speaker sounds ten times more robust than the standard echo. Fills the room with great bass and sounds much bigger than the footprint it takes up. Highly recommend,5,0.862,Positive,29
1761,"Our kitchen/dining room/sitting room are all in a very open space on the first floor of our house. This thing is great for providing quality sound in the entire space.

1762,"Echo Studio fits in with my video wall. High Def Flat screens with Amazon HD Sound completes in home studio experience. Intend to continue with Wifi lighting and wifi light switches at later date. Echo Studio can act as my household WiFi Hub. Controlling all rooms in the house; lighting, HVAC Control. Over time Echo will be the hub I use to make my digital home come true.",5,0.5423,Positive,68
1763,Well the only thing is it doesn't have enough bass for me I like just a little more bass but other than that its first rate.,5,0.3182,Positive,26
1764,This is by far the best alexa device I have bought. The sound is amazing. You can have the volume full blast and alexa still responds. Extremely easy to get set up. By far a 10 out of 5 star! Would most deff suggest buying this.,5,0.9097,Positive,46
1765,Not exactly all it was hyped up to be in my opinion. I expected to be blown away by the sound quality and 3D immersion. I was not that impressed not $200 bucks worth. Could have had a Bose for that price.,3,-0.4973,Negative,42

I'm using it as expernal pc speaker, with analog input. Works well for that too. Sometimes the audio goes to power save, but a loud volume on the input line will wake it up.",5,0.6124,Positive,40

1772,Recently upgraded all Alexas to the larger Studio devices. While the sound is much better the devices don't always recognize voice commands. Even standing right over it and clearly saying stop playing music it pauses to listen to me but then resumes playing music. Not worth the extra money by always having to repeat myself asking simple commands the device and sometimes ignored all together.,1,-0.0384,Neutral,65

1777,"Disappointed! There is plenty of bass, but the music does sound like it's coming out of a little box. It's slightly better than the Echo Show, but not enough to keep it. I don't understand how other reviewers can say it's like the musicians are really there.",3,0.8463,Positive,47
1778,The sound quality is different from the quality of the display item in the store. Have to now purchase a sub-wolfer to improve the bass.,5,0.4404,Positive,25
1779,I love the product pretty good sound. but if you need to yell at the thing to turn up or down or to change music it seems to be a problem.,3,0.2732,Positive,31

1785,The sound is fantastic. I've been listening to an echo and a couple of dots. This filled the room with really rich sound.,5,0.8173,Positive,23
1786,"Bought this for the kitchen after moving an Apple HomePod to another room. Out the box the sound is not as full as the HomePod. Worked with the eq a bit and was able to get more full sound. The Alexa integration is great, as she is smarter than Siri.",4,0.7964,Positive,50
1787,Voice recognition needs and second request fairly often. The sound is good overall but I had expected a bit more bass. Perhaps that is why the subwoofer is being sold. I have a Sonos One also and have to say the sound is better with Sonos but the Alexa integration is weak.,4,0.2382,Positive,52
1788,"Great sound and features, the only flaw is that when it’s connected to tv via optic cable you can’t control volume from your tv remote.",5,0.6249,Positive,25
1789,"Based on what other reviewers said, I purchased 2 speakers to pair in stereo. It really does make a difference. When I start music and sometimes only one speaker plays, I can tell immediately.",5,0.25,Positive,34

1795,Got this for the garage to integrate Amazon music in addition to the Echo Link. The sound is so awesome we plan to buy more for other rooms.,5,0.787,Positive,28
1796,"As expected, the Studio features greatly improved sound quality as opposed to the Echo Dot 2nd Generation that I had been using. The bass is resonant and punchy even at low volume and the higher frequencies are clear and crisp. A big, immediately noticeable improvement. Setup was seamless- essentially plug 'n play. This device is money well spent, IMHO.",5,0.8858,Positive,59
1797,I have 2 Echo Studios and Echo Sub. Love the sound and Alexa integration. Set-up a little wonky at times. Overall very pleased with the product.,5,0.8122,Positive,26

1799,"I have a 2nd gen echo and was looking at an upgrade. i am so happy I did!

I am not sure why there is so much hate for the stereo spatial enhancement. Review after review, I see the recommendation to turn this feature off. Without it, I find the sound to be thin. With it on, I hear a rich balanced fuller sound

This is great for my apartment and I couldn't be happier with this purchase",5,0.7199,Positive,78
1800,Honestly I was hoping to like it. Tried to hook up to tv with optical cable and there’s a sound delay so it looks like everyone is lip singing... the sound wasn’t that great either...I was hoping for better. Also linking groups of echo speakers should be easier. They get disconnected. Tech support was good but they said they get these complaints often.,3,0.8567,Positive,63
1801,"I set up 2 of these devices in a pair, and had them play some music as a pair. At first, the balance seemed a bit off, but soon, it was perfect. It had adjusted itself for the room perfectly. I'm hearing things in songs I had never heard before.. a bass riff here, the individual voices in a harmony there... this is better than even high end headphones.",5,0.968,Positive,69

1804,The sound is good when it actually stays connected. Bluetooth constantly being dropped. Goes offline all the time.,1,0.34,Positive,18
1805,Very disappointed in the fact that it would not link with my two echoes to simulate a surround sound and the bass was sub-par.,3,-0.5256,Negative,24
1806,"Great sound quality! I have several in my house, and recently gave some Prime-Day ones as gifts.
The one I use the most is in my bedroom on my night-stand; I use it as an alarm clock, a radio (with TuneIn Radio),
for emergency weather alerts and daily weather, music (Amazon Music Unlimited, my Pandora radio stations),
and to manage-and-control Alexa-enabled home devices.",5,0.2714,Positive,63

1809,I love this speaker! Great sound and really good bass from an Amazon speaker. Once I went into the Alexa app and brought the highs and Mids up a little bit the sound was fantastic. I will definitely be buying another one.,5,0.9627,Positive,42
1810,"Genuinely impressive for a small sound source.

Update 11/22/20 On my second unit. Just super glitchy. The optical cord creates havoc with this thing. You have to yell at it. Mic on my dots are way better. The price far exceeds the value. Sound quality is impressive when working just don't expect consistency as a television add on and to raise your voice.",2,0.9186,Positive,63
1811,The Alexa Echo Studio is amazing. My husband loves it. It delivers great sound quality and has so many options available to my Prime account.,5,0.9118,Positive,25
1812,"I LOVE THE MUSIC ON THIS DEVICE!! However, I also use the Studio as a sound bar for my tv (it is an older tv so this is just my experience with that), and a lot of the time, the sibilant sounds from dialogue seem to distort the tweeter. I’m not sure if it has to do with some sort of age difference between the technologies, but it’s a bit disconcerting to be listening to a show and that distortion occurs every few minutes.",4,0.3441,Positive,84
1813,The voice recognition is better then some alexa products and with alexa integration i cause add other speakers but the sound quality alone is very good,5,0.5775,Positive,26

1815,Sound is better and I’m glad I spent the extra $ to get this. Looks nicer in my living room then the other models.,5,0.8316,Positive,24
1816,This is a great sounding speaker for it's size. The way it seems to fill the room around you is incredible for the price.,5,0.6249,Positive,24
1817,"its loud with really nice sound, however, some songs mid range are a little out of whack. but it is worth the money",5,0.5262,Positive,23
1818,Great speaker at a great price. I have a second one arriving today to pair with my first one (that I received shortly after these were released). The whole Ultra HD and 3D music subscription is not a gimmick and sounds wonderful...if you're a music lover like me this is an excellent and fairly priced device to enjoy listening to music and movies!,5,0.9709,Positive,63
1819,The set up was easy. The voice recognition took a few days to catch up. This was replacing my original echo which was series 1. I am very glad I upgraded to the Studio rather than the echo.,5,0.8173,Positive,38

1822,Love this echo. Very well made and very powerful. Great for listening to music and for using as a Bluetooth device.,5,0.9333,Positive,21
1823,This was a gift for my wife as I could not stand her playing music through the dots. The sound quality was such that my neighbors ordered one the next day for their home.,5,0.32,Positive,34
1824,"Definitely a great product as far as sound, and functionality. When it comes to registering my voice with saying ""alexa"" it isnt the best. My echo 3rd gen seems to be better in the mic aspect. Either way, great product for the price. And sounds very very good. Not sure why people arent a fan of the 3d audio or whatever its called, sounds great with it on, and worse with out. But to each their own.",4,0.7475,Positive,77

1831,Excellent sound. Syncs up with my fire stick HD quite nicely. It definitely fills the room with high quality audio when you call for it. “Pair” (pun intended) this with your TV and Amazon Music HD for a truly pleasant experience.,5,0.9366,Positive,41
1832,Paired with a second studio for excellent hi-fi reproduction - Mozart in the bedroom! Vivaldi to gradual sleep!,5,0.6467,Positive,18
1833,"Sounds good until it stops playback, usually about 1min into anything. The only way I’ve been able to fix it is to mute the microphone, which basically makes this a Bluetooth speaker without Alexa capabilities.",2,0.3182,Positive,35
1834,Unbeatable sound for the price. The highs/treble seems to be washed out slightly. But it still sounds fantastic.,4,0.7096,Positive,18
1835,"I have friends with Alexa (not the Echo Studio) and I was surprised at the sound quality. I ordered the Echo Studio because it was the latest model.

1848,I like the fact that echo studio is waterproof and I can use it safely on my patio. Studio best Quality in sound is best used indoors but I wanted better volume and quality of sound outdoors. I will likely get another to replace my 2nd generation echo.,4,0.8979,Positive,48

My other disappointment is that it won’t pair with the fire stick remote.",2,-0.5204,Negative,71

2024,The sound was a definite upgrade from the 1st Gen Echo we were using. It also seems to get more reliable wifi reception (not sure why). We mainly use it to play music while playing pool during the lunch hour and it's added more quality to that time.,5,0.5168,Positive,48

Mind you it is not a substitute for an integrated amp with decent speakers, but it sound good enough and is much more compact.",4,0.8422,Positive,64
2036,Must buy! Absolutely amazing sound quality. Extremely easy to connect to my fire cube/fire stick. I use the echo studio and echo dots as smart surrond sound. A really cool feature is it ask which era of music is your favorite. Example- I like rap. Alexa said which decade is do you prefer. 80s 90s 00s or current. 200$ well spent,5,0.9522,Positive,61

2044,I like almost everything about the speakers. I have two and they sync'd together for stereo. My only gripe about the speaker is that when you are in Amazon music it cuts out because it has not received any command during a set time period.

2087,These sounded good when we first purchased them. However Amazon did something to them and they sound like absolute garbage now. They have zero bass and they sound like tinny garbage.

I have 2 of these and the sub synced with a Fire TV CubE, the problem is that the sound sometimes goes out of sync with the video.

4721,"I think the fact that amazon has overlooked a very large market here is astounding. People with high def systems what a simple alexa device with an optical out ""a la chromecast"" and for some unknown reason amazon has yet to deliver on a simple device that could net them millions. For people in this niche', we do not need external speakers only a way to direct the signal bit perfect to an outboard dac. Till they see that there is a large market share that does not want an allin on BT speaker I will stick with my casting.

4722,"Sooo.... Yesterday, I went in to do some work for my Dad, and his Echo Studio Speaker was there for me to set up.

I actually couldn't get it set up correctly, because nearly all my siblings were there, and the pulses and sounds it was sending out forced me to turn it down, so that everyone could talk - and then he changed his mind as to which room he wanted it in...

C'est la vie...

The speaker is not tuned, and now it's in the wrong room, but it works and plays music...

Though it is not tuned, I was impressed by the heft - It weighs about as much, if not more than my and my dad's Klipsch speakers - we got him nearly the same setup that I have for his home cinema.

As it is, it does not have the clarity of treble/voice that the Klipsch speakers have, but it is a much more rounded speaker - and especially in the base portions of the spectrum.

The staging is a lot more clear with a pair of Klipsch R15s, but for a single speaker it's pretty phenomenal.

There are a lot pricier ones that come with Alexa, but my mom would ABSOLUTELY balk at the pricing on those... On a dollar basis, both my Dad and I were amazed, and most importantly he was pleased.

I had considered picking out the Sonos1 for what he wanted, but he has so many different apps on his phone, and he can never remember the passwords, so setting them up becomes a nightmare. I didn't want to add one more app I would have to figure out, when the Amazon product would do most of the work itself, and I wouldn't have to troubleshoot later.

Aaaaaaand speaking of troubleshooting, he remembered he wanted his Tile app integrated with Alexa, which took another hour, and then, somehow, his Pandora account was deactivated - but I knew the password on that, so that took another 10-15 minutes...

I was going to show him the Tile skill was working, so I asked ""Alexa, where are the keys?"" and Alexa replied:

""Try retracing your steps.""

Which made my Mom and Dad burst out with laughter - they were laughing so hard they could barely breathe!

My Mom asked, ""Who programmed this?"" and my Dad said, ""Are they looking for an argument? This is messed up!""and then they laughed some more - and I told them, ""Well, If you're an argumentative person who is married, maybe you can just argue with Alexa, instead of your spouse!""

And they laughed some more, and my Dad said, ""I know some newly divorced men in the Congregation who could use this!""

And then they laughed some more.

After the laughter died down, I looked up the skill, and you have to say, ""Alexa, ask Tile where are my keys"" - and Alexa gave the current address the keys were located in.

And then I asked Alexa, ""Where's my dog?"" And Alexa responded, ""I don't know, maybe it will come back when it's hungry?""

Which made my parents laugh again...

I got zero work done, but my parent's agreed to pay me for fixing all their tech instead...

Next weekend I'll have to reconfigure the Echo Studio for the room it's in now, and I'll have a better understanding of its sound quality...

But first impressions were similar to those I have seen on You Tube Evals.

For $200, my Dad bought a UE Boom, and the list price on my Flip4 was $179. Those are not smart speakers, and it blows them away.

I bought a pair of R15 Klipschs, and they are better in most ways but not in some, -I bought them for $80, but the list price was $450, and they are not smart, and need a receiver. It's also not as good as many Logitech and other computer speakers, but they are also dumb, require more space, and can't completely fill a room with sound.

Even at full volume, there was zero distortion.

For a home theater speaker - though it's not configured yet, my ear tells me it's not going to be a substitute for a receiver and dedicated speakers so you can hear lips as they speak and sing... but for a smart speaker that you listen to while going about your daily activities, it's very, very good...

I have heard the Sonos one in stores, and it's not Klipsch, but there was a lot of commotion when I listened, so I really can't compare it to anything.

But my dad is more than pleased, for now the UE Boom he got is connected to an Echo Input- I plan to get him a Logitech computer system for that, and the Boom can go back to his truck and worksites...

C'est la vie... 5 stars, for what it is.",5,0.9955,Positive,819
4723,"This thing is the reason that Amazon Music HD doesn't play back Atmos or 3D audio on any other device. I refuse to buy Amazon's hardware for this, and not only that, it makes me LESS likely to buy Amazon services and products.

I DO NOT want Alexa. Nor do I want these low quality speakers. I have a receiver with a built in streamer that supports atmos. I have a nVidia Shield TV Pro that supports Atmos. I have a full 7.1 or 5.1.2 speaker setup (switchable on my receiver) with pretty nice Elac speakers and an SVS subwoofer, and my front speakers are powered by a pretty nice Adcom amp that was designed by Nelson Pass.

This winter alone I've spent a couple thousand dollars on upgrading my system for multichannel and surround music. I have a plex server where I host my own music and have been trying out multiple streaming services: Tidal, Qobuz, Amazon.

I don't like Tidal because of MQA. Read up on it, but it's basically a form of DRM with lossy compression masquerading as a hi-res ""lossless"" format that somehow is DRM free, except you have to have a DAC or software with license for playback and it's a whole shit-show. But Atmos playback works on the Shield TV. Pretty great UI though, at least, comparatively.

Qobuz: Hi-Res Flac support. Doesn't have an Android TV app but I can stream it to my receiver directly. No multichannel/3D/Atmos. Android app UI sucks.

Amazon: Lossless Flac. 3D/Atmos support with proprietary hardware that spies on you. 3D and Atmos only work on a receiver if you also buy their streaming stick. So I have to buy two pieces of hardware that aren't even necessary, Amazon only requires this because they want to move hardware and get Alexa to spy on you at all times. App UI sucks but is slightly better than Qobuz. Slightly. Blatantly anti-competition and anti-consumer.",1,0.9707,Positive,322
4724,"I've had it over a month now so k felt like this would be a good honest Review.

I purchased one at first and then another and then the echo sub, the sound is amazing. Highly recommend, but there are 2 flaws, one major with this set up.

1. Linking all the studios and sub to the tv was a pain. Chat support didn't really know what to do, I finally decided to call and talk to someone, he had me working in 5 mins.

2. And this is a major flaw for me. This system only works with fire TV. Not the Blu Ray, Xbox, ect. You can hook up opt to aux cable directly but you will have to unplug each time you want the fire TV/Xbox. Also you won't be able to have the sub.

If this system worked with what ever was on the tv, then this would be my recommendation for everyone. Hopefully that will come later.",3,0.6344,Positive,162

4726,"A great way to make your house smart with Alexa, the functions range from answer questions, setting an alarm and play music to control the doors and locks of your house. Definitely a must!

The sound quality is not perfect at all, you can find better speakers for the same price. I would recommend to use 2 Echo Studio devices in stereo. The sound improves a lot! There’s also a dis-balance in volume between Alexa’s voice and the music it plays, so you always need to adjust it.

The appearance is not bad, but it’s a shame that the light ring that indicates Alexa’s status can be seen only from above and you cannot really know if it heard you or not, you must be right there.

I expected more of this Echo…",5,0.6917,Positive,133

4728,"My husband bought the studio and a sub as an upgrade to our existing Echo Plus. We had a good set up with 3 Dots, 6 plugs, and about 10 Sengled Zigbee light bulbs that worked exactly as we wanted. We expected that the Studio would do the same, just with better sound quality. However, none of the light bulbs will connect to the new studio and neither will the sub. We’ve tried everything, including fully resetting the bulbs and spending hours on the phone with customer support, but nothing has worked. To make matters worse, we tried putting everything back to how it was with the Echo Plus, and now the bulbs won’t connect to the old hub either. DO NOT buy the studio to upgrade your current system until the software is fixed! So frustrating!!!",1,-0.8191,Negative,137

The mids and highs seemed masked and trying to to get out but don’t quite make it. Push the volume and it does not improve the sound it actually seems to make it worse. I was in Costco and they had the Bose Home Speaker 450 on sale for $269, a tad more then the Echo Studio speaker but upon listening to the Bose at home for a week it was worth the extra cash. The Bose sound is clearer tighter and more pleasing imho. When you push the volume it does not disappoint; clear, clean. and pushs higher volumes much better than the Studio. The Echo Studio is well built, impressive upon first evaluation but listening time exposes its weaknesses.

4731,"Browsing through these reviews there is a lot of hit and miss reviews that arent really telling you how it gets used day to day. We have had this since right after thanksgiving 2019, and we are very happy with this speaker. It is powerful, very powerful. I don't think we ever turn the volume above 6 or 7 because the bass and sound becomes too much on our first floor living room. 3D sound is nice, but hard to find consistent video/audio that releases in Atmos. We use spotify so not getting the full 3D effect right now. It is a center of attention for parties, has enough sound to take over a room, and it really is not too noticeable sitting on and end-table. If I had complaints, it's the standard software issues Amazon usually has compared to its competitors Apple/Sonos/Samsung. The app is so clunky, if you don't know where to go, its not intuitive. I would always hesitate giving any Echo device to parents/grandparents due to the software in the app. Also anytime we connect to the Fire TV, we have to back out of the menus, back in, disconnect from Echo Studio, reconnect, etc, It just isn't primetime yet. BUT, the Hardware, the speaker itself, is an absolute steal, and probably a loss leader for Amazon right now.",5,-0.3307,Negative,223
