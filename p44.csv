0,"i have owned a few kindles now, 3 mindle keyboards, followed by a paperwhite (2014 model) and now this model.

this model does NOT allow the use of active content, so it is ebooks ONLY.

if you pay to remove ads, you lose 22$ and you KEPP the ADS you paid to REMOVE.

the weeks long battery life of previous models is not the same with this model, though the box suggests it is.

last night i recieved mine, charged it up fully, stuck it in my backpack and went to sleep, this morning it has about 10% of a charge in a period of about 10 hours without use.

the 2014 model is superior to this model in every way except storage space, but if you have to stay plugged into a wall i can read in color on my android tablet.

going to return this kindle, it is NOT as advertised.",1,-0.0848,Negative,153
1,I bought this kindle to replace an old keyboard one. I wanted one that I could read in bed without a light on and also needed to be able to adjust the type size. This meets my needs perfectly. I read about 45 min to an hour every day and the initial charge is still about 70% after a couple weeks. I purchased the bundle and like the fact that you simply have to close the cover to turn the kindle off. Very happy with my purchase.,5,0.8932,Positive,87
2,"I have had my kindle white for about 4 years, it is reliable, easy to read and easily to hold in any position while reading in bed or your big rig. Being able to order and download as much material as you want and not have to worry about disk space is nice,",5,0.8521,Positive,53
3,I can't insert the USB cable in my Kindle Paperwhite.,2,0.0,Neutral,10
4,"I received this as a gift to replace a beat up PaperWhite I'd had for a few years. I LOVE IT! It is lighter, brighter, so easy to use. Do wish it has an * in the keyboard, had to reset my Amazon password to connect. But this is great. I don't know about the charger, I have only used my old one, which fit fine.",5,0.9632,Positive,66
5,"This has quickly become one of my favorite things.
Things I love:
Backlighting- perfect for reading in darker spaces, such as in bed at night and while others in the room have the lights down to watch a movie.
Screen- is clear and not hard on the eyes at all. I can read for hours.
Waterproof- which makes this available for the beach or poolside.
Size- this is where I was unsure I would like the e-reader. However, I love it, it is compact without taking away from the reading experience, font sizes are adjustable and it feel seamless to switch from paper to this e-reader.
Battery- last for days with daily reading
I do not have any cons 2 months in",5,0.9612,Positive,122
6,"I am very happy with my new kindle. This was a replacement for my 2nd generation kindle and I couldn't be happier. I bought the bundle and the case is very nice. This is much smaller than my 2nd generation but that's because it's a touchscreen and there's no need to make it large with a keyboard. I decided to get the wifi only one because once you download load the books you don't need to be connected. I also got the one with special offers know I can pay 20$ at anytime to turn them off. The honestly don't bother me at all and so far the seem to be based on previous purchases. I'm looking forward to potentially finding a new book or series from the special offers. The things I like most are the size, weight, backlight and water resistance (my 2nd generation was destroyed by a water damage, freak accident caused by a leaky roof). At this time I've had no issues and have no complaints.",5,-0.33,Negative,170
7,"Kindle is great ... it's my third. However, did not receive the leather cover.",3,0.6249,Positive,14
8,"I bought this to replace the older model I lost. This paperwhite is not faster. It will only connect to 2.5ghz and not 5ghz. I have to disconnect many devices to get Wi-Fi.
The most disappointing thing is no easy way to download the files to be able to use the text to speech feature. I have spent hours talking to the customer service people trying to solve the problem. This is the second paperwhite I have purchased. The first one was sent back, because Amazon thought it was defective. The problem persists in the new paperwhite that was sent to me.",1,-0.9185,Negative,102
9,"I love my Kindle! It was very easy to set up, and I like that I can change the font settings/sizes if I wish. It is easy to adjust the light to read in the day or during the night. The battery life has been great, I try to read about an hour a day and after two weeks, it is down to 67%. I bought the bundle with the case and chord and I love the battery saving case, that turns it on when opened and off when closed. Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchase!",5,0.9808,Positive,98
10,"This is my 3rd Kindle. My first two were Fire tablets. The first one wore out and the second one got to heavy to read with my arthritic hands. The Paperwhite is light and easy to hold. My only complaint, and it's a major one for me, is that you can't change the lighting to night time reading before bed. It has the back light feature so you can read in bed without lights, but you can't switch it to the blue light feature to make it easier on your eyes so it doesn't interfere with sleep. This is pretty stupid since this is a reader only! My Fire Tablet had this feature and it was great. Not too smart on Amazon's part from my perspective.",4,0.613,Positive,126
11,"I thought I could go back to a Paperwhite after using Kindle Fire for years through several changes. I am now using an I Pad as well, so I. believed, perhaps, I could just download only print and carry one less device. NO. It is true. You cannot go home again. I remember so long ago when a woman in a doctor's office showed me a Paperwhite, and told me the joys of reading online. Little did this English major bookworm realize that I could have 3 hard copy books going and 3 or more online books being read too and think it was wonderful. The smaller Paperwhite is just too small for me to re-adjust to, and I ended up returning it. I know people who read on their phones, but I read far too much and read far too long to adjust to either phone or the smaller device. I will always remember the first Paperwhites with nostalgia, but it just did not work for my new reading horizons.",2,0.6124,Positive,171
12,"The good: I love the screen size, the water-resistance, and that there are no buttons that can be pushed by mistake. The bad: the screen doesn't always do what it is supposed to do. I push the left side to go back and it often doesn't go anywhere or it only goes back a page or two and then loops back to where I was originally. Sometimes the forward touch on the right side of the screen jumps forward multiple pages. Both issues can be quite annoying.",4,-0.4576,Negative,87
13,It’s nice it sleeps n save battery when u close the cover. Battery last days. Just the touch screen (I don’t know if it’s cuz I am used to smart phones) seems to sort of glitch...turns black then white before it goes to the screen you choose. Again it could be cuz it’s intentionally made this way so we feel like we aren’t using our phones but an old thing closer to the feel of books. I heard it breaks down after a year or so...hopefully I will be able to use it for years as this is my first ever purchase of kindle kind. Thanks amazon.,4,0.9454,Positive,107
14,"I bought this, my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite. Paperwhite #1 was dropped 4562 times and finally broke. I left, my dear friend, Paperwhite #2 in a budget rental car and it was not recovered. I bought a new Paperwhite and will get a new rental care agency too. It seems a bit nicer than the 2016 model (#2). The screen is smooth and there is no lip where the bezel meets the screen. It may be a bit faster as well. I think the screen is clearer but it is hard to tell as the screen of #2 was pretty scarred. Overall it is a great device. I look forward to reading hundreds of books on it as I did on my dearly departed Paperwhite #2.",5,0.9587,Positive,125
15,"I bought this item because it also played aubible books. The problem is that this kindle does not play the books without a headset and my headsets don't seem to sync well with this kindle. Even though I have dedicated two headsets to this
10th Edition Kindle, the Kindle can't seem to recognize the sync and will not connect. I have called both Amazon and Audible regarding this issue and am completely fed up. No one seems to have an answer and I am left with a product that is unusable and virtually worthless.",1,-0.2263,Negative,94
16,"I traded in my Oasis for this Kindle.
I did not like the battery life in it.
My older paper white I have been using works great. I hoped for the same with this one.
Big disappointment. Lately I have been busy and have not been reading as much so mostly all I have done on this new one it to download books. In a months time it used up 65% of the battery life downloading books only and not reading. What a disappointment! Come on Amazon new and improved is something you should have considered in the battery life. On my old paper white I can read 6 hours a day and still will have more than 40% battery life left at the end of the month.
Also when are you going to start using the usb c cord adapter for recharging like most are using now.
Thank heaven most are changing to the C because traveling with so many cords takes up a lot of space in your suitcase.
There are 2 of us in the house. We have 9 devices to keep charged that is a lot of cords.
So far with replacing items with age 6 can now use the same C cord. 9 cords plus their plugs is a lot to keep track of at home let alone while traveling.",3,0.8216,Positive,225
17,"First off this is different than the ""fire"" type tablets or any other multi use tablet I've had. The good is that it is lite weight. I can pop it in my purse and take it anywhere. It is also very comfortable to hold, which is important for folks like me that read for hours at a time. It charges fast and holds a charge forever it seems. Now the bad news. The look of the screen is dull without the needed contrast. It is designed this way and although it works it doesn't excite the senses and seems to be less appealing than either of my older ""Fire"" tablets. I am older and the lack of contrast is harder on my older eyesight.",4,-0.732,Negative,124
18,"I love to read. I have bookshelves in every room. But I thought that by getting a Kindle, I could carry 'my' books everywhere and read anywhere. I can, and it's awesome; no one knows what I'm reading or when. The light is dimmable, the subscriptions are great. I wish they had something like a ""Science Fiction Book Club"" or something to help me tread thru the thousands of titles and authors, tho'. Many of the books shown to me in my chosen genres are short, oversimplified, and unpalatable. The only real problem is, though, that it doesn't last for as much as a week per charge; 5 or 6 days at most. I know that I read a lot, but I expected better. Still, it does what the advertising says for the most part, and I am content with it. I'll still need to plug it in during my vacation, though!",4,0.9751,Positive,152
19,"I had high hopes for this e-reader. I have had a 5 button ancient Kindle for years. I love everything about it except you can't read it in the dark. I finally decided to replace my old companion when the battery started failing. But here's the deal...this is a poor substitute. It's hard to read the main screen (the book/library part) The font can't be adjusted on non-book pages. My old Kindle had page turner buttons. The Paperwhite requires that the side of the screen be tapped. Sometimes the page turns sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the page shrinks (expands?) into some kind of overhead view. So I wind up fighting the (damn) thing. Yes, you can read this in the dark...yay! But overall the brightness hurts my eyes. I can turn the light down but then I have difficulty seeing the script. I haven't bothered to try to see how the glare is outside. In fact, I lost my Paperwhite and I doubt I will look very hard for it. Personally, I want my old fashioned button pushed, 5 button control, broken down Kindle for reading.",3,-0.9694,Negative,186
20,"I was hesitant to buy this because I had become very comfortable reading on my iPad mini-5. Yet, I was always getting distracted at night by the convenience of just browsing the Internet and shopping instead of reading. So, I wanted something that would focus me on reading which is exactly what the Paperwhite does. Also, I was a little concerned about using the type screen found on the iPad late at night. I wanted something that would be easier at night on my eyes. I think I've found the perfect device to read at night without the bright lights nor the distraction.

The only small problem I've had is getting the Paperwhite to come on after shutting it down at night. I don't turn it off, I just close the cover and it should go to sleep. Well, in the morning I'd open the cover and it would show the normal book ad, but that's it. It wouldn't start up and the screen seemed frozen. So, I chatted with the folks at Amazon and they told me to do a complete reset and see if that helps. I did that and so far the Paperwhite is working as advertised although I think the battery life is somewhat shorter than advertised.

I got my Paperwhite bundled with a case and charger so it was a complete package and well worth the price. I would definitely buy again if I needed to do so.",5,0.9329,Positive,243
21,"Somewhat of a disappointment. Battery life is marginal but it is easy to read with because the back lighting is adjustable. My BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT is that NOT ANY of the word games I enjoyed playing on my old Kindle transferred to this ""new"" version. WHO BUILDS A PRODUCT THAT IS LESS FUNCTIONAL THAT IT'S PREDECESSOR???....and then doesn’t tell you the fact that it’s ONLY A READER. For me this was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!",3,0.3103,Positive,73
22,"This is not my first Kindle, and it's probably not going to be my last, but it is definitely meeting all of my reading needs now. I love my Kindle and Audible books, so I love that I can have both in one device when I travel. I love being able to use Whispersync to easily move between the Kindle and Audible versions of my books when I use the Kindle, and I'm excited to try the waterproof feature on a trip I have planned. Paperwhite Kindles are my favorite. I love that I can read day or night and not have issues with glare. I love that it is a great size and weight to just toss into my purse or backpack and have anywhere. The battery life has been great. I am a heavy reader at times and I still can read several books before my next charge.",5,0.9961,Positive,150
23,"This is my first kindle. I normally use my IPhone or IPad for reading. The thing is, with those items, I did everything else but read. Anyway, I thought a kindle would be great and keep me focused. I received the case and adapter first then about 3 weeks later, received the actual kindle. I’ve never seen them in person and didn’t realize they were so small. It took a couple days for me to get used to it but it seems like I’m reading an actual novel, just the screen is brighter. I’ve been reading nonstop and it’s convenient to carry with me. The only downside is that there is a delay when touching the screen and the internet doesn’t work that well in my opinion. But I’m supposed to be reading so I won’t be to hard on it. If you are used to iPads or tablets, this takes a couple days to get used to but overall I’m glad I’ve purchased it.",5,0.965,Positive,165
24,"Excellent battery life, love it, don’t use as much as I thought I would but well worth the purchase",5,0.8381,Positive,19
25,"I have purchased several Kindles over the years. I bought a Paperwhite for myself for Christmas. I also moved before Christmas and I lost track of it but found it weeks later.Kindle books are cheaper than hardbacks and sometimes older books are almost the same price as paperback. I like to read all kinds of books so if I am not paying attention, I can run up a big bill at the bookstore and end up putting some back. I know that I can use the library but often the ones I want are already checked out. A Kindle works for me. I also had a Kindle Fire that you could put music on. Once when my husband was in the hospital, listening to my favorite music allowed me to sleep well.",4,0.765,Positive,132
26,"I am loving my new Kindle. It is easy to use, and I love that I can change the font so easy. I having been thinking about getting one for about 2 years. Crazy I waited so long because it is GREAT. It is so easy to read in bed even with no lights lit. You do have to be careful touching the screen; it's very sensitive, and you can move to pages you don't want to. I purchased a bundle package, and so glad I did. I got the Kindle, case, and the external charger. When my Kindle is at 10%, the external only takes about 2 hours to charge to 100%. Best of all, I do not have to have my computer on to charge the Kindle. Now, I have not tried it, but maybe the computer does not even need to be turned on, but I read where that type of charge takes longer. I love that I can still read while the Kindle is charging. If you are thinking about getting a Kindle; I say go for it; you won't be sorry.",5,0.9709,Positive,186
27,"I purchased this bundle during Amazon's Prime Day last year. I was happy to get what I considered to be a good deal. I wanted a Kindle specifically to read books since the Kindle app was taking up too much space on my phone. Overall I'm happy with my purchase but it does have issues that haven't been resolved. I've contacted customer support for the Kindle and both times I was unable to get the help that I needed. I've noticed a bit of a lag at times with the books, as well as some of the print from the previous page appearing on the next page, almost like a watermark. Customer service assured me that I was given a new product and not a refurbished product. I have 3-yr insurance for this product, which I strongly recommend. I hope that with updates and fixing of any bugs that this product will get better.

The battery life is good. It can last for at least one week, depending on usage. I read on my paperwhite at least twice a week and the battery seems to last. At least once a month I allow the paperwhite to drain completely and then charge it again to 100%. I read online that this helps the battery to last longer. So far it seems to be working.

Oh, the experimental browser is okay. It links to Amazon and other sites. I'm not really a fan of the experimental browser but I suppose I'll have to get used to it.",5,0.9912,Positive,255
28,"I’ll be talking to customer service about how a Kindle WHITE should not be YELLOW!

The screen is nothing like my older Kindle which has a beautiful white screen that is easy to see and read from. It looks like real paper, but this new Kindle isn’t at all like a real book looks.

The yellow background makes it very difficult to read.
I’ve found all the settings and made every adjustment I can to no avail.

I’m going to give Amazon’s customer service a chance to fix this by chat or phone, but I have a strong feeling that I’ll be returning this new Kindle YELLOW.",1,0.8536,Positive,107
29,"Battery life is insane. I feel like one charge lasts me a month. I connect to my local library and download my kindle ebooks that way, its an amazing device. The only negative thing I will say is that I feel there is a bit of lag time from when you touch the screen to when it responds, definitely not as quick as other touch screen devices I have used in the past. However, I absolutely love the device in general for its purpose, the screen adjusts in different brightness levels almost instantaneously which is a great feature.",5,0.908,Positive,98
30,"My trusty Gen 2 Kindle Paperwhite appeared to bite the dust so I ponied-up for a new one. I quite enjoy the new hardware, waterproof design and simplified Operating System. I find the Operating System to slightly less stable and have experienced a couple of unplanned reboots in the several hundred hours I've used the reader. I expect an over the air update will fix that in time. BTW, it turns out my 7+ YO Paperwhite didn't die, the Kindle AC adapter did. Well now I have a back-up :-D",4,0.9485,Positive,90
31,"Thought I would be getting a much faster processor and longer battery life than the Paperwhite I bought some years ago. If anything, the battery drains faster, and the processor speed is much the same. Only thing different from my old Paperwhite (which still works very well) is the flush screen. Oh, and I guess I can read in the rain!!",3,0.4547,Positive,61
32,"I have had 3 previous kindle fire tablets and I mostly (95% of the time) use it for books. I received the paperwhite as a gift as the paperwhite is highly recommended for those who use it for mostly reading. My kindle was almost 7 years old and beginning to have problems. I needed a replacement and was willing to give this a try. Turns out I really like my Kindle tablets! In addition to kindle books I check out books from the library using the Hoopla and Overdrive apps. You can't put apps on a paperwhite so that interfered with my ability to get books that I wanted. I returned the paperwhite and got the 8"" Kindle fire and am very happy.",3,0.7827,Positive,123
33,"I was disappointed in this product. Up to this point in my life I have not had any kind of e-reader. The biggest drawback of this product to me to me is that everything is in black and white. Maybe the majority of people buying these devices already knows that. I did not. I wanted to use the device to read books for myself, children’s books for the kids and magazines for free from the library. I don’t want to read color material in black and white. I returned the Kindle and got an iPad 10.4” 2019 model. It was more money but the iPad has so many more great features that to me are worth the extra money.",2,0.8775,Positive,119
34,"Although there is a little bit of a learning curve for those unfamiliar with e-reading, so far this Kindle has been very pleasant. It comes with an instructional component and I also found easy to follow instructions on my laptop upon receiving this product in the mail. Some of the attempts I've made to follow the instructions haven't ended up giving me the intended result, but I think this is part of the learning curve, not the device. Easy to hold, easy to read, fairly easy to navigate, I think it will be a great addition to our household! And I like that it comes in a sturdy case and is waterproof, as well!",5,0.9659,Positive,114
35,"I guess it's the difference between having a Kindle with ads and without ads. I've always bought the Kindle without ads, and there's no delay when starting the device. When I open the cover, it automatically opens to the book I was reading or the home screen. With the new one, there's a solid 5 second delay where opening the cover wakes up the tablet, then you have to swipe the screen to activate it. I find that delay super annoying, and I'll definitely pay the extra $20 to get the Kindle without ads from now on.

Another minor issue is that the lack of bevels which make it awesomely waterproof, and cat hair stuck in the screen resistant, also make it slightly harder to hold when you're laying down reading in bed. My fingers just kind of slide around on the sides of the screen.

It's still a good device. It's still worth having the screen quality offered by the Paperwhite. Next summer, I'll test out the water resistance at the pool. It'll be nice not having to read with my Kindle in a ziploc bag. If you're looking for a speedy process of opening the book and being able to read almost immediately, though, the older version without ads is better.",4,0.5197,Positive,213
36,"Too bad my 2nd gen kindle finally died. After a decade of heavy use, Gen 2's battery gave the heave-ho. Well, I got this new paperwhite and it's ok. The battery life is amazing. The navigation? not so much :( It droves me absolutely nuts for the 1st week. I wanted to throw it out the window! Now I'm used to it but whew. Steep leaving curve - I could not get to the font menu to change sizes and finding my way back to my main menu is awkward. And all these book suggestions... I loved the old sketched photos on the start-up screen.
Eh, progress, not so much but it will do.",4,0.8339,Positive,114
37,"The Kindle Paperwhite is sold as having specially-designed lighting that does not keep you awake, and a distinctive font for nightreading. It is easy to hold with one hand and can be read in total darkness. It also has a very long-lasting battery. I am not very adept at maneuvering ebooks, so perhaps I should not comment on this aspect. My principal criticism is that the page is so tiny that a 110p Joseph Conrad novel runs to 390 screens.",3,0.4951,Positive,80
38,"Have used it ALOT, but it has some problems - 1-Waking up seems to take too long;
2-Occassionaly, the screen freezes and I can tap all over the screen, but nothing works until it is ready, then it is like nothing happened;
3-I like have information available on on the bottom, like page, location, % read, BUT that info has disappeared and I have to go through the process to add the information, AGAIN.
4-At times, the screen goes blank and I have to turn it off, then back on and it works right.

Set up was not working even after trouble shooting. Sent it back, again no issues with the returns. Appears it was a glitch int he system for the set up and maybe a bad batch regarding the ear phone jack. Was a little disappointed because my old kindle of 7 years worked fine from day one. It still works but the battery after such long use doesn't hold the charge any longer. It is just one of those things.",3,-0.9543,Negative,122
40,"I had the old paperwhite, which didn't have a backlight. The battery lasted MUCH longer on the older model, however, it completely stopped charging within 3 years.

41,"I do enjoy trips to my local library, always have. Also, at the library I can cheaply buy authors and titles I enjoy. But, it is nice to just throw this little device into my purse and run off to the nail salon or beauty shop and easily select between different books or magazines I feel in the mood to read at the time. It eliminates the need of having to know before I leave the house what book or magazine I'll really be in the mood for ahead of time.",5,0.9423,Positive,91
42,"My 9 year old Kindle wouldn't hold a charge any longer. So I had to order a new one. Love the display and brightness. Charged it again last night. We'll see how long the charge lasts this time. Not too keen on the touch screen to get to the next page or trying to find the menu to get home, settings etc. And marking the last page read takes getting use to. At least it does sync with the Kindle app on my phone and laptop. So I can get to the last page read easily.",5,0.7423,Positive,96
43,I have an older kindle with a key board and buttons on the side to forward /reverse pages. On the paper white if you accidentally touch the screen you jump pages or chapters and then have to find your place. It is lighter ...

What I REALLY do not like is having to first get past the advertisements before I can get back to the place I left off. I paid for the Kindle, and I pay for Amazon Prime and for other books. This isn’t some free app where I expect to see ads as the price of using the app.",4,-0.0086,Neutral,101
51,What a bummer this new reader is!!! I use my old reader because I have never figured this one out. I would very much like to trade this one infor one of your cheaper readers that aren’t useless and confusing...please advise me on this trade. It is in perfect condition because I never have used it...I have always been satisfied with the quality Amazon has sent when I have ordered but this is a complete piece of trash!,1,0.6069,Positive,78
52,"This was a birthday present for my husband, who had grown to love using my Kindle and wanted his own! He just loves it! It works wonderfully, and I was able to transfer our library from my Kindle to his (with a little help from Amazon tech support). Nice to be able to both read the same book at the same time, if we want to.",5,0.9684,Positive,66
53,"Battery life seems fine. It has good weight and usually fits larger pockets, coats and bags well. The font is easy to read. The backlight is nice. I have a bit of trouble at the end of books though. I seem to get stuck on the last page and the inevitable coercion to buy another book with no way back to the home screen. Also, it is a bit slow to enact a command, maybe to use less battery power, but it just runs s l o w l y .",4,0.8957,Positive,91
54,"I recently traded in my kindle for this new upgraded addition and I am happy to say that I absolutely love it. The lighter weight, selection of color and the battery life are some of the features that made me decide to upgrade and since it was bundled it was a great value and definitely worth the price. I would recommend this newest offering to anyone who is an avid reader like myself you will not be disappointed.",5,0.9799,Positive,78
55,"I find it difficult getting comfortable with the Paperwhite Kindle. The non-glare screen is wonderful, but I've had the Kindle Fire for years and like the color book titles and ease of highlighting and the ease of using the dictionary and highlighting.",4,0.8555,Positive,42
56,"It's small, it's light, it's waterproof, it's easy to read (with or without light) and the power lasts forever (at least for the 3 months I've had it). My wife has the Fire which is harder to read and keeps needing recharging. The Fire has other reasons to buy it but if you're just using it for reading, this is fantastic.",5,0.6652,Positive,61
57,"Not what I had hoped for. The print for books is adjustable, but navigation print is not. This is ridiculously difficult to use with poor lighting and small print. I only use it occasionally when I'm in the sun and need something small for my bag. I would think that after multiple versions, these problems would have been addressed. I don't recommend spending so much money that is so inferior to kindle fire. I wouldn't but it again, it doesn't meet my needd.",2,-0.959,Negative,83
58,"This kindle is not user friendly. It is very difficult to get out of the amazon store and get to your library. It is just an avenue for amazon to sell more books. If you are

Paper white!",1,-0.7655,Negative,54
59,"My mother was just telling me yesterday how much she adores her new kindle. She reads every single day. She, like most of us, grew up on paper books and was skeptical about the switch. She's thrilled she did and finds looking at this paper white technology to be extremely easy on the eyes and the lack of physical books to be very practical. Much less waste. She also rents books on it.",5,0.6232,Positive,73
60,Absolutely love my Kindle!! This is my second one. My first (Generation 2) is still working beautifully but I just wanted a new one. My husband is now using my first one. My Kindle is never more than a few feet from me. Always has a book in progress and usually one in the queue. LOVE IT!!!!!,5,0.9575,Positive,57
61,This Kindle has more storage than my first Kindle that got too full. I love it. Touch screen works smoothly and I charge it about every two weeks. Recharges very quickly. Cover fits perfectly and is very nice.,5,0.9099,Positive,38
62,This is a great e-reader. While I miss my Kindle keyboard this one has been a joy to own and is easy to navigate once you get used to it. The one thing I dislike is there are times the touch screen is too sensitive. Overall a great product and easy to use.,5,0.9393,Positive,53
63,"I love reading outside by the pool. I do hate it when I forget to download my books and I find myself without wifi and wanting to read -- that's the only downfall of this Kindle. This paperwhite is so easy to read and use, I love the thin compact size!!",5,0.8452,Positive,51
64,"The backlight is great for reading in bed. Love that it's lightweight and fits in my pocketbook easily. The cover has a suede lining so when you flip it over you can rest it on your lap and it doesn't slip. For the most part, I borrow books from the library and read them for free on my Kindle. Cover and charging cable sold separately, but I bought them bundled for a reasonable price.",5,0.7906,Positive,74
65,"I love the new Kindle, I had a ten year old one. It was time to get a new model.
The paper white is easy to read, especially at the pool or beach this summer. The touch controls took some getting use to but it's pretty user friendly. I am very happy with my Kindle and would recommend it if you are looking for a reader. I have so many other devices in the house these days, I wanted just a reader and it fill the bill!",5,0.9725,Positive,87
66,"Love my new Kindle - 10th generation, replacing the 6th Gen one I still have. Battery life is not as good, not sure why.
Software - I frequently change the brightness and font size at night when reading in bed. It takes more ""clicking"" with this one.
I appreciate the water resistant status, the lighter weight, slightly smaller size.
I will gift my older one or keep it for traveling.",4,0.8415,Positive,70

69,I love my new kindle! The new cover is great for keeping it protected and also for positioning while reading in bed. I bought this bundle on a great Black Friday deal but the quality would be worth buying at regular price. And plus is that I can take it into the bath with me as it is now waterproof.,5,0.8832,Positive,60
70,"Got this as a gift for our 92 year old Grandma to replace her original Kindle that had lost its battery life. She absolutely loves it. The highlights is the long battery and the back light, which she says makes reading so much easier. The touch screen is a little sensitive, but she is getting used to it.",5,0.669,Positive,58

75,"Does everything it is supposed to. Putting it in Airplane mode when the network is not needed greatly extends an already decent battery life.

I found the paperwhite screen had a bit less eye strain when reading for long periods than my iPad Pro. I found owning both was far worth it.",5,0.1006,Positive,52
76,"My friends raved about the Kindle and wise ones suggested I could get along with fewer bookcases if I had one. So I gave myself one for a birthday gift. I was amazed at how simple it has been to upload books and carry it around! The light is just right and it brings a new definition to ""flipping pages""! I still have more to learn about its features and usage, but so far I recommend the Paperwhite Kindle very highly.",5,0.8855,Positive,81
77,"Disappointed with this
Bundle purchase - would not pay this much again
I think it’s ridiculous the plug is not included with the Kindle
Don’t see anything special about the leather cover
Should have just purchased the kindle alone
- don’t think this was a great buy,overspent",2,0.127,Positive,47
78,"Didn't care for that way overpriced charger included in the bundle. Kind of like a car dealership charging for undercoating. This was my first Kindle. Pretty happy with unit. Battery life seems good provided you don't continuously use the backlight or wifi. I prefer a reading lamp to using the backlight, but it's nice that it's an option.",4,0.8355,Positive,58
79,This is the first e-reader I have ever owned so it's great being able to have this to take with me. I like the size and the fact that Audible is automatically already on it. The cover is great. It doesn't take very long to charge and the battery life is really nice and long.,5,0.9334,Positive,55
80,Get everything you need to start using it. Small enough to use with one hand. The backlighting has a good range and the battery is amazing. Missed having one and this was definitely an upgrade from my old e-reader.,5,0.886,Positive,39
81,"Love kindle readers! This is my third one! I love this version because I can also listen to my Audible books w/Bluetooth headset. Will continue to use the other working reader for books I'm reading. Love the size too, its like holding a paperback book but extremely thin.",5,0.8456,Positive,48

84,"upgraded my Kindle Fire for this as I wanted a black screen with white text option.That setting has a ghostly, washed out look to me. I have adjusted the brightness level to try to get a crisper text, no luck. My wife reads on an ipad, black screen, white text. HUGH difference in the clarity and the ease of reading.",3,0.4442,Positive,60
85,"Charges fast. Long lasting battery. Lightweight, fits into small to medium sized purse. It came with a lot of advertisement for books.

89,It was supposed to take almost 2 months to get but came in super fast. The charger and case comes in a couple weeks before the actual kindle. It is a little smaller than the last gen but I love it the battery life is so much better. The only thing I wish is that there was better colors to choose from.,5,0.9772,Positive,62

91,Wife loves it and downloads library e-books regularly. Only wished that it would display the book's cover as she forgets that she's already read some because there's no cover picture to commit to mind with the title. So much easier to download books on a Kindle than it was on now discarded Nook.,5,0.6573,Positive,53

94,I love my Kindle! I wish my pages were longer (frequent page turns) and that my books weren't so expensive. The best part is that I don't need a reading light and I can just open it and poof I am right where I left off.,5,0.9128,Positive,46

220,"I have had a Kindle since shortly after they came out. The first one I had worked easily, but didn't have a backlight and you had to either sit by a bright light or have a sperate light hooked to it. When they came out with the Kindle Voyage I upgraded to that. It has always been great. When I saw the ad for the Paperwhite I thought I would try it. I have been very disappointed with. It does not respond quickly to a command and it has only 3 sizes to choose from for the size of type font. Also it doesn't hold a charge any longer than my Voyage. I have returned the paperwhite and am using my Voyage.",2,0.7657,Positive,122
221,"My older generation Kindle reader, which I've had for last 5-6 years was having battery issues. I am an avid reader, and had to charge it every day. When I called Amazon tech support, I was told that I had damaged the battery by reading books while on the charger. The associate recommended buying the latest generation paper white with a new and improved battery, with much greater charge capacity. He said my previous generation model was designed to hold a charge for days but with improved technology a new paper white battery could hold a charge for weeks! I was sold. I also read the same thing in the advertisement, so I bought it. The first thing I noticed is that it does not hold a charge any longer than my old reader. I started with a full charge and after using it for 8 hours there was a 47% charge remaining. That's about how long my old model reader performed before it developed battery issues. I also read in the users manual that it's possible to read while it is on the charger. To say the least I was furious that I had been grossly lied to by Amazon about the greater capacity battery. I bought this as a bundle, and called to demand approval to return the entire bundle. The associate I spoke with told me that reading while on a charger does not damage the battery, but it will cause temporary erratic battery behavior. I won't go into the details of how she tried to explain why the manual said you can use it while charging, but didn't say that doing so would cause the battery to temporarily malfunction, or why the paper white is touted as being able to last weeks on a single charge. It was ludicrous, but still quite an amazing performance; a combination of a razzle dazzle old soft shoe song and dance routine and a circus barker exhibition. And what's more amazing is it all seemed to make perfect sense to her. This devious lady was well trained on how to parse words, but lacked the integrity of a sincere associate trying to provide good customer service. The only good part about this is that my old Kindle battery is no longer acting erratically. My take away from this is Amazon cannot be trusted to tell the truth about any of it's product lines and services. Whatever you do you should not buy a paper white thinking that the charge on this model will last any longer than the charge on a older Kindle model....because it won't.",1,0.9911,Positive,436
222,"Now I'd like to put one on my wishlist for myself.... and they all are ""Ad supported"". What the heck, Amazon??!! Not JUST no.... If I'm buying something, I do NOT expect to then have to deal with ads ! I could even -maybe - see it if it was at a HUGE discount.... but you're charging pretty much the same price I paid for the non-ad-supported ones I bought in past years. I was really looking forward to getting my own this year, but it will be a cold day in hell before I purchase a device that is ""ad supported"". I can't believe you stooped to that.",1,0.7052,Positive,109
223,"Thanks to Amazon's helpful team of support staff, I learned how to turn this new device on.",3,0.8126,Positive,17
224,"I was excited to get this ""new and improved"" Kindle as a present, but ugh, what a disappointment it is. Granted, my old Kindle is ancient (buttons, no light), so I was prepared for a bit of a learning curve, but this thing is CLUNKY and other than being backlit, seems like a step backward for Amazon. It is a huge disappointment.
Pros: Love the backlit screen. Great for reading in bed at night. Soft light is easy on the eyes. Battery life is decent.
Cons: The Touch Screen: Sorry, I hate the touch screen. I'm not a fan of touchscreens in general, but who the heck came up with this design? It's either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. ""Forward"" takes up the bulk of the screen space, while ""Backward"" is just a bit of the surface area on the left. Turning the pages feels like WORK, which let's face it, shouldn't even be a factor when you're reading a book. The touch screen can be so sensitive that I end up skipping ahead too many pages, or changing the font size without intending to do so. Sometimes I have to tap the screen repeatedly to get the page to turn. Too sensitive, not sensitive enough, I never know what I'm going to get with this touchscreen.
Another Con: Loading existing Library. Getting my previously purchased books loaded onto my new Kindle and into a list is ridiculously complicated. Waaaaay more complicated than with my old Kindle. Too many taps required, added in with the often overly sensitive touch screen, and I end up adding books to the list that I don't intend to, requiring me to then to have to delete the unwanted titles. Again, too much work for what should be a pretty straightforward process, which btw, it is on my old Kindle.
Overall con: It is just CLUNKY. Did I mention that before? Well, it is....Can't say it too much. Clunky, clunky, clunky. When you have to work so hard to read, you know something is wrong. The book should be the focus of attention, not the the navigation of the Kindle, itself. Amazon: Keep the backlit screen, bring back buttons (on BOTH sides of the Kindle), and PLEASE figure out a way to make navigating the features within the Kindle much more user-friendly.",2,0.9055,Positive,388
225,"I have dyslexia. I’ve never been a big reader when I didn’t have to be. It was horrible. HOWEVER, Kindle comes with the ability to change fonts and it has the Open Dyslexic font.

228,"My old Kindle fire is getting very old and had a glare when trying to read outside. So, I bought a new Kindle Paperwhite. What a mistake. Yes, the Paperwite is lighter and can be read outside, but those are it's only advantage. All of my access to public libraries was wiped out and there seems to be no way to get it back. The carosel on the old Kindle was much easier to find books in my connection. Screen is much smaller enabling one to read only about two paragraphs before have to clink on another page. The ads take up most of the front page. Will send it back",1,0.431,Positive,111
