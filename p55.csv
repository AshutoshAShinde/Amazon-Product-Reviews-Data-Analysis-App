0,"So I don't write reviews but I believe for this kind of product it's a little scary because about 50% of KN masks are not protecting the consumer because of either bad stitching or they are not using the proper materials. For the amount of money we are wasting we need real reviews with proper feedback. Ttimes like these it's hard to let a dollar go to waste.Okay, so I just received mines and immediately went and did the water test. For those that don't know, you want to do a water test to make sure droplets aren't going in nor are they coming out. So what you do is put water inside the mask and hang it by the ear handle things and keep it there for a while. If you see water coming out even a drop then that represents a leakage and it's no good. So far I'm about 10 minutes in and I see no leakage. If I see any I will update this review.This review is for the Black KN 95 mask 20Pcs",5,-0.9473,Negative,178
1,"I am vigilant about wearing masks during the covid pandemic. I had 4 N95s from previous home improvement projects at the start of the pandemic, now it is December and they are all used up. Looking for replacements, I saw these and liked the looks of them. They arrived today, and so far I’m well pleased. I have a medium size head. I gave some to my dear neighbors who likewise have medium size heads and they were highly impressed.
The front of the mask is well off my nose and mouth, making talking and vigorous breathing easier. The seal around the edges of the mask seem tight and secure, even around the nose (I wear glasses, and recommend wearing the mask high on the bridge of the nose and using glasses to help secure the upper seal). My glasses fog some, slightly less than with the N95s, but it’s a function of wearing cold glasses next to water vapor in a northern Michigan winter. I’m unused to ear loops, but I expect I’ll adjust. The ear loops seem snug. There was a faint “new mask” smell, it was tolerable and quickly disappeared. I like that black hides grime well (my trusty N95s, once white, are not any more).
These are true 5-layer masks, good fit, good price. I will heat sanitize, and put several in rotation, to extend their functional usefulness. With some luck, 5 of these will see me through to vaccination (I have a strong background in physiology, molecular biology and immunology, I would take either of the first two approved vaccines without hesitation) and until the “all clear” is given.
Good luck y’all, god bless, and see you downrange.",5,0.9966,Positive,283
2,"Pros:
--All 20pcs KN95 masks arrived in an exquisite sealed bag.
--Try to tugged on a couple ear loops, very strong, none have broken.
--Snug fit, soft, and comfortable.
--Receive in 5 days, 1 day delaied, but ok for me.
--Certificated manufacturer, I have searched the manufacturer at the time when receiving the package, and found it on the FDA list. I believe the mask can offer trusted protection.

Cons:
--Have a very very slight smell but it did subside after a while, maybe I am sensitive.
--Don't feel as heavy as those my friend gave us, but close, I think they are good.

Others:
--Have a feeling that we'll use masks for a while since winter is coming, so I consider ordering.",5,0.9713,Positive,123
3,"I have been wearing masks whenever, I leave home. The KN95 masks are, the best I have worn without doubt. At the beginning, I feel hesitate to buy these mask because I think it is hideous beak shaped. But its coverage is fantastic, fitting closely around my face. I feel much safer than I have in any other common mask I wear before. One small complaint is that the tight fit may slightly decreased comfort--but I would rather have a mask with well protection than one that hangs loosely. Most importantly, this is the first mask I've used that doesn't fog my glasses; probably because the nose bridge clip can be adjustable to a tight-fitting. Overall, I recommend these KN95 masks.",5,0.965,Positive,121
4,"Price good, looks good, works well with different situation, speedy shipment...thx",5,0.7845,Positive,11
5,I ordered these because I read some of the f the reviews and I was specifically looking for black N95 masks. These masks were perfect - no smell - to any one them like some of the reviews had said. I will orders these again.,5,0.6124,Positive,45

 I had to do some research after I got these and saw reviews that they were expired and repackaged....so not the case but ""2019"" is the model # not expiration date. I attached the picture from CDC that approved GB 2626-2019 as kn95 masks. They don't recommend this in the medical field but instead of surgical masks or homemade masks. My town actually used to give these out but from the Arun brand, and we found them super comfortable an easy to breathe in. These are actually a bit thicker but still very comfortable and for anyone that wears glasses, these won't fog up your glasses. They are a bit smaller but my husband prefers these from the Arun's bc he doesn't have to adjust it to not make it fog his lenses and they fit his face just fine. ...also...I washed them by accident and they came out just fine :) hope 20 can last me a couple months.",5,0.9852,Positive,167

10,"We are now in year #2 of the COVID-19 crisis. For the first year I had been using a really good cloth mask with filter insertion. I actually prefer these type of masks due to the fact they are lighter and washable.

However, now we find ourselves with a new U.K. variant of the virus that spreads much faster/easier than the Devil we know already. Those dinky masks that most of us have been wearing are going to offer minimal protection against this new threat.

It's a tough choice when looking over a wealth of mask choices as to whether you are getting a product that will actually protect you. As you are doing now, I poured over dozens of Amazon products and reviews. I also did some basic Google research on the best masks to buy and this one came up repeatedly.

This is a KN95 mask which is a variant of the N95 mask that healthcare workers use in hospitals. N95 masks are the US standards for respirator masks; KN95 masks are the Chinese standards for masks. KN95 standards include testing for fit, while the N95 doesn't. There is quite a bit of controversy over how effective KN95 masks like these are (compared to N95) so it's difficult for me to make the argument that these will be as effective as the PPE used in hospitals despite the claims made by the manufacturer. One positive notation to make is that this manufacturer appears on the FDA approved list.

What I can tell you is that the masks do appear to live up to the manufactur's claim. This seems to be an extremely well-made product that features 5 layers of protection. Once looped to the ears, the fit and seal is very tight. While not as comfortable and easy to breathe as cloth counterparts, these certainly feel as if they offer superior protection.
For those of you like myself who wear glasses, this mask features an adjustable clip which allows the mask to bridge nicely around the nose. Unfortunately, no matter how tightly I adjusted the clip, I found there still to be just a little bit of fogging on my glasses, though extremely minimal and a HUGE improvement over cloth masks.

Honestly, I don't like the ""beak"" look of these KN95 masks, but we have come to the point in this crisis where protection is more important than being fashionable. I decided to go with black as I wanted to have that ""Bane"" look from the Batman comics/movie. The adjoining loops and their connectiive joints feel very strong. This mask doesn't feel cheaply made and I certainly feel more confident that I am well protected while wearing it.

These arrive as a box of 20 masks. The masks are not individually wrapped but rather presented as two sealed packages of 10.

With the new U.K. variant set to dominate our country by March, everyone should be looking at change up to N95/KN95 masks. These seem to be one the most effective means of protecting one's self.",5,0.9854,Positive,508

 Anyone else sick of covid? These seem to be pretty nice disposable KN95s. The Blackness matches my soul at this point.

16,These masks have a strong chemical smell. I wore one for five minutes and it actually gave me a headache. They've been returned.,1,0.5106,Positive,23
17,"The mask smells like a combination of a strange chemical and smoky beef jerky. The only way I can wear one is to hang it on the screen porch with the fan running for four of five days. That helps, however does not completely get rid of the smell. I am concerned about what I am breathing. Is is worse for me than COVID? I hope not a purchased a big package of these.

The piece which goes over the ears is too small, my husband and I are not large people, yet it pulls our ears forward, so that they hurt.

I do like that there is more room in the face area, that is a plus

I do not recommend this product.",2,0.2792,Positive,124
18,"My husband and I are tall but slim people: 5'8"" 155 lbs for HER and 6 ft./157 lbs for HIM. The mask fits HER perfectly. I enjoy having room in the mask so that it's not brushing my lips when I talk or sing. The elastics are fairly soft and comfortable. For HIM, however, the ear elastics were TOO TIGHT :( I had to splice an additional 3/4-1 inch into each loop to prevent uncomfortable pressure, or it would never be comfortable for a plane ride. I'm glad I have elastic and the ability to sew, but I bought these masks hoping that they would fit ""as is"".",3,0.9516,Positive,108
19,"I am a petite adult with a small face. I would say this mask best fits for a small or medium face. I love that it’s black, and it passed all of the tests for KN95 (candle test, water test) in addition to being on FDA approved list. These masks are well-made and I haven’t had any issues with the ear loops coming off or tears. This is a good purchase for those wanting a little extra protection when out and about.",5,0.9217,Positive,82
20,"I perform entrance screening in hospital emergency department and clinic settings where Covid-19 patients are frequent. I feel safer in a 5-layer K-95 mask like these, that filters out most pathogens. With 5 layers these masks are thick, but comfortable. The elastic bands are strong, but stretchy enough that they don’t make my ears sore.
They are also reusable. At the end of a work day, I hang them up and spray them, inside and out, with a fine 70% alcohol mist. They are dry and ready to wear again in a couple of hours.",5,0.9178,Positive,95

 I was reluctant at first to buy KN95 mask on Amazon and to top it off write review.
Well after reading reviews decided to give it a try
Order delivery is prompt
Came well packaged
This is what my Pharmacy husband has to say:
Material is thick enough to provide a safe face covering
It is light weight, comfortable to be wearing it for whole day.
The design makes breathing whole lot easier.
Covers well from right under our eyes to end of our chin.
Only con: give a bird like beak look.
Overall A+ for comfort and protectiveness",5,0.948,Positive,106
23,The mask covers very little of one's face. No matter how how I put it on it just doesn't fit right like any of the others I have bought over the last year. The smell alone is awful. Makes me feel like I am going to throw up.,1,-0.6998,Negative,48
24,"This mask is perfect! I was hesitant with a few reviews, but I can confirm that this mask is not small or tight (and I can own the fact that I have a big face). It’s very comfortable to wear and I feel very well protected. The metal bridge to tighten around the nose is sturdy. Its a thick mask, but I am able to breath just fine. I also have a big nose. I will definitely be buying more of these.",5,0.9645,Positive,82
25,"Fairly comfortable, and they appear like they will filter well. I feel much safer using these than I do with a cloth mask. They also seal around your face well, and don't fog my glasses if I position them carefully. The elastic straps are tight (they need to be to seal) without being too tight. I still can't wear it for a full 8hr shift without them hurting my ears, but I'm not sure such a thing exists.",5,0.6526,Positive,78
26,"After having numerous mask, cloth, ones with filters, and even comparing against mask that I had when I spent 20 years in the Army, these mask are very good. You have to work to contour it to your face but when you do, the fit is snug and firm which is what you need and want in these pandemic times. I highly recommend you purchase these mask or at least consider them before you buy others. They are worth it.",5,0.8965,Positive,80
27,"Kn masks are ""K"" for Korean made with very high standards. These are Chinese! I was looking for Korean made and didn't pay enough attention. They are throwing around EU and FDA but that rating they talk about is NOT for this mask!!! It is for a respirator -a breathing machine for hospitals... geez. If you read the reviews many have poorly written English. A mask should NOT hold water! If it holds water it is not breathable which is unhealthy and will completely steam up your glasses as there is not place for hot moisture to go but up into your glasses. High price for a bunch of false claims.",2,-0.7663,Negative,111
28,"If you have worn a N95 mask and expect these KN95 to be the same, they aren't. My N95 fits tight below the chin, and around mouth and nose. When I blow out, the air goes put through the mask. KN95 lets air blow out through the top and across my eyes. Adjusting the mask does not help. KN95 does not make a tight seal at all.",3,-0.3935,Negative,67
29,"I've used many different masks and of all the ones I've used I like these the most. They just seem to fit my face better than the other masks I've tried and I can tell that they have a really nice seal, plus most KN95 masks I bought in the past were basic looking white masks and I prefer the black color of these. The straps feel nice and secure, I have purchased masks in the past where the straps snap almost instantly but I haven't had a problem with these.",5,0.8745,Positive,91
30,"What's the point of having a special mask with five layers when the model number and decorative elements are stamped into the mask, creating a sizable section near your mouth where there is only one layer of material (the interior one) instead of five? All the cross-mask decorative seams, the model number, and the seams around the nose wire are created by heat stamping. So those areas are basically reduced to just one layer (the innermost one), rather than five. See how light shines through in those areas on the picture. I would be OK with the structural parts around the nose being like that, but having such a large area next to the mouth be one layer is just not smart. The mask is pretty comfy, and looks good, although it does not prevent glasses from fogging. But I would not recommend. At all.",2,0.8574,Positive,145

32,"We've ordered these masks twice now, and they are worth the cost for the extra protection over a cloth mask. I have a small face, and I'd say my husband has an average face size. They fit him very well. I have to knot the elastic to make them a little tighter on my face, but otherwise they are good. Very breathable, which they should be. Most important, they are on the FDA approved list. We first ordered them because we were taking a road trip to see our children, and we had to travel through states that have no mask mandate, or don't enforce it well. So we knew we would encounter unmasked people in restrooms on the road, or going into a hotel. Having the extra protection was necessary. With the more contagious virus variants, we have continued to use them when going into public places like the grocery store. Also, because they are meant to be breathable, they are more comfortable to wear for extended periods than thick cloth masks.",5,0.9282,Positive,173

35,"The mask is comfortable. It is very secure, contouring to all angles of my face. NO puckers, openings.
The FIVE layers are good, and still breathable.

The only negative I will say is they made the ear loops out of nylon vs cotton. In a store it has slipped off my ear. I do not like to touch my face while out.
It's a great mask, in a sealed pkg. I font know why this flaw was made Nylon is too slippery Cotton ear loops stay in place better. I dread having to switch all of the masks I bought to a cotton ear loop. But for safety, reliability, I fell I have to change them myself.
The main mask is very good.
I would recommend. Perhaps the nylon ear loops won't be as slippery to cone off on others.",4,0.9302,Positive,140

43,"It is difficult shopping for masks online. So like many people I have been through a bunch. These are probably my favorite so far. There is an (unattractive) forward space that makes the mask stay away from the nose and mouth. Because of this, even though the mask fits well all the way around (top, bottom, sides), I can breathe pretty well. IE, I don't feel that air gets around the edges, and the material is thick enough that not much air passes through. However, there is a little pocket of space in the front that keeps the mask away from my mouth and nose. That makes me feel like I am not being smothered. And due to the snug perimeter My GLASSES DO NOT FOG! And the colors are saturated and therefore less clinical/medical looking. The accordion masks look better than these, but they do not make the ""seal"" that these do. These fit myself (small jaw/face) and my husband (broad jaw/face) well.",5,0.9031,Positive,164

I have to say they fit great, felt great, but I now have all 20 of them opened up and airing out on my guest bed for the next 24 hours to dissipate the smell.

These masks are very thin, and although they have a manufacturing number on them- they are missing the important letters TC in front of that number required on such actually approved KN 95 masks. The photo's above were taken using my PC's camera and in them you can see another telltale sign of an incorrect mask manufacture of a actual KN 95 mask- it has ear loops instead of headband ties- these ties are crucial in making a KN 95 mask work properly, ear loops are no goo.

After almost a year of wearing surgical masks, these straight up felt like a severe asthma attack. Like waterboarding minus the water. Definitely fit tightly enough to create significant negative pressure. Almost like a Darth Vader effect, possibly because I had to take such deep breaths to feel like I was getting any oxygen. Did a decent job of preventing glasses from fogging for the 10 minutes I could stand wearing it. Felt lightheaded afterwards but I’m pretty sure I still don’t have covid, so!

They are comfortable and fit nicely, with no air gaps. When I tried running, the hard exhales pushed the mask off my face and breath leaked out the sides and bottom (could potentially fix by tightening straps?) They fog glasses a bit more than lightweight medical style masks, though not because of air gaps; it seems like some breath just goes through the fabric in an upwards direction. For daily wear without glasses, they are great (once you air out the stink). For exercise, I will need to try tightening and maybe a tape hack around the top of the cheeks to reduce fogging.",3,0.9505,Positive,136

Most masks are way too big for my face. These fit really well. They are nice & snug so you get a good seal, but are still comfortable enough to wear all day at work. The ear straps are about the perfect length for me too. They are short enough to make the mask seal well, but not so tight that they hurt my ears.

I used these as an added 2nd protection layer suitable for new COVID19 strands, and it fit formed to our medium sized faces fine.

63,Great N95 mask which fit my normally XL cloth mask face! Fit is snugger than cloth which is the purpose. Not uncomfortable at all and my glasses no longer fog up! So much better than the cloth masks. Wish that I could have purchased these a year ago.,5,0.9387,Positive,48
64,You can imagine that we have all tried different types of masks over the last year. This is by far the most comfortable mask that I have had one in the last 12 month. There is a very slight odor when you first put it on but it either goes away or you no longer notice it. Ran some through the washing machine yesterday and they cam out looking like new. I had one of those bags that you place delegates in. Will buy again but hope I can just keep washing them. I keep one in the car and will go 3-4 of on and off use before I feel I need a new one.,5,0.7647,Positive,116
65,The first thing you notice is the strong chemical smell that the masks have. The strength of the smell slowly gets better with use. The second thing is that these masks are just a tad smaller then standard N-95 masks and keeps riding up on the nose bridge. I don't have that problem with regular masks I wear and that's from a retired RN.,3,0.8924,Positive,64
66,"I purchased these KN95 face mask primarily as a backup for public situations that might need a bit more visible compliance with CDC guidelines. I prefer a face shield. The masks fit well and are as comfortable as a face mask can be, I guess. I do not have difficulty breathing through them but the buildup of heat one my face is why I use a face shield instead. The straps hold up well. It is easy to breathe while wearing them. The delivery was pretty fast. Again, I prefer face shield's but these will work in a pinch and are reasonable priced for a disposable product.",5,0.941,Positive,107
67,"The quality is not as good as advertised, it is so thin that is doubtful if it is truly 5 layers of protection and it is uncomfortable both inside of it and the elastic bands behind the ears.

68,"Doesn't ""seal"" with the face as with all the dome shaped N95's I've had in the past. Even if I twist the straps, it doesn't get any more secure than that. I usually put another surgical mask on top of it to make it tighter.",4,0.5413,Positive,45
69,"Air, like so many things in this world, flows along the path of least resistance.
if you exhale while wearing a mask and feel your breath hitting your eyes, the incoming air will flow through that same gap when you inhale, rendering the bulk of the mask useless (filtering nothing).
I bought these as they are noted for the fit; they appear to fit no better at all than any other that I have owned.
It is odd to me that no manufacturer has appeared to address this problem effectively.
I added a star as they appear to have an official FDA certification.",1,-0.3466,Negative,103

71,"I needed some better fitting and more protective masks than my cloth ones. I took a chance on these and am glad I did. They are very comfortable, and fit snugly, but not tightly, around my nose and mouth. They have a nose piece that makes it fit even better. Because of the way it is constructed, the front of the mask does stick out a little and gives an odd profile, but it makes it much easier to talk and to be understood while wearing the mask. I will be purchasing more when needed.",5,0.938,Positive,95
72,"Received these and they were sealed in a package. Tried it on and it fit kind of loosely all over. Tried pinching the metal nosepiece for a good fit and it feels cheaply made (compared to an actual N95), and does not have any sort of seal. You can smell coffee beans right through it like there's nothing blocking it. My fabric mask does better at blocking the smell. Very disappointed and returned these. For the price, they are not worth it and won't protect you like an N95 type mask should.",1,0.547,Positive,92
73,"This is the best mask I’ve purchased in the last year—I’ve ordered it three times—twice in black and once in white. It fits my small face comfortably without any gaps, but my husband says it’s too tight for him and the loops hurt his ears. I feel very protected wearing this mask (supposedly it has five layers) as well as protecting others.",4,0.704,Positive,62
74,"Compared to another kn95 (another brand) i have these are bit smaller for my face and much more pointy. Looks like i beak on my face lol. Also now that they are smaller more air escapes to the top of my mask fogging up my glasses even more. Wouldve loved These to come individually wrapped so i can put them in my bag without worry of getting dirty or damaged. Another issues is the smell, not sure if it because i have the black mask but my whites dont have that strong smell. It goes away after awhile but still lingers in the mask. The upside is that material looks like good quality and breathing seems easy. Not sure i would buy again because i have had better experience with my other kn95",4,0.9229,Positive,133
75,"Not a flimsy mask or a fashion statement. You can really tell it is different. When you inhale, it creates a suction effect, so I don't think I'd use it if I were exercising vigorously.

76,"I very rarely write a review and usually not a bad one, however I received this product a few days ago. Although they don't look bad when we removed them from the wrapper they have a strong, bad smell. I would compare it to be soaked in gasoline or something similar. I do have all the masks laying out hoping that they air out, if so I may revise my review but for now the smell is so bad, these masks would not be wearable. I'm very disappointed.",1,-0.8472,Negative,88
77,I am 120 lb woman with an average sized head and these are too big for my face. The top of the masks gets uncomfortably close to my eyes and the bottoms hangs off my chin.

Will have to pay extremely close attention to the size, which is listed in millimeters. Just wasted my money.",2,-0.8555,Negative,72
80,"Good masks. What I expected. However, they are made in China, and have been shown to be below US standards, so I wear a mask over it.

84,"I had other mask we were using too and by the time we started to use these it was after Jan. 31.
Unfortunately, this product does not work for me and my sister. Are they for children?? The ear loops are really tight and can't be stretched, making the mask very tight on the face, squeezing the cheeks under the eyes, which is not comfortable! The mask are also too small. I know it says after January 31, item can't be returned, but I have no use for them and have wasted my $39.99 plus tax. It was February 2nd of first use. Please advise on return still.

87,"I am not 100% sure if these are included on FDA's list, but they do seem good quality. None of the earloops have broken on them yet, and my household has been using them for 2 weeks.

The combo feels secure and as safe as the 3M N95 masks that I had before the pandemic and ran out of. These KN95s are not individually wrapped.",5,0.9169,Positive,88
89,"I had high hopes for these masks given the recent guidance to choose K95 masks over less effective cloth masks, and the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Unfortunately, the masks were too big and didn't fit my small face (I'm a very petite adult woman) properly. I wore the mask when carpooling to my son's soccer match, and it kept slipping down, leaving my son's friend and me improperly protected. I will try to donate them and stick to cloth masks with a filter insert.",2,0.9021,Positive,85
90,They do have an odor when you open the package at first. After 10 minutes the smell goes away. The masks fit perfect and you can talk through them easier.

Also, one earloop came off the first and only time I put one of these on my face.

The description says they're approved by the FDA and the European Union. I checked. The company that manufactures them is on the FDA list. This seller claims these masks are from that manufacturer, but there's no way any agency would approve masks that are sieves.

COVID-19 is spreading faster than ever in the US. But people are dropping precautions. I looked forward to masks that are nearly as protective as the N95, not in COVID-19 hospital wards but everywhere else.

I'm disappointed and disgusted. I've depended on Amazon and its great customer service in recent years. But now a lot of the people listing products are selling cheap, poorly made Chinese crap. Often many sell the same junk at the same price. Go elsewhere for masks without holes.

Photos: The good one shows light coming through perforations. The bad photo shows many of the holes and the light coming through the KN95 emblem. One shows the earloop that came off.
