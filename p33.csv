0,"What a book! Wow!!
If you want a strong, courageous, downright heart wrenching novel with a woman named Elsa Martinelli and her lionhearted children, this is it!
Elsa Martinelli has a good life living on a farm with her in-laws and two children in Texas during the 1930's.

Then in the blink of an eye --- The dust bowl comes with no rain, wind storms and no crops! Their farm animals are dying, crops are withered, and food and water are scarce! People have dust pneumonia.
Life has taken a dramatic turn!
Elsa decides after much turmoil to take her children and seek out a better life in California.
""Courage is fear you ignore."" She will make this journey for her family!
This is the land of hope, good and plenty!
Will they find the rainbow or just more devastation?

At this time in our country with our own pandemic, this is certainly an emotional, thought provoking novel that I read deliberately.
I could feel all the pain, heartache and challenges during this time in history and how similar they are at this present time to then!
Ten stars for this brilliant story!
It will not be forgotten anytime soon!",5,0.9782,Positive,200
1,"It's now 3:00AM and I'm sitting in my living room, and I'm so moved and ready to fight..
As we enter a new year with the same pandemic and political strife, so much of this book will open your eyes to the plight of those less fortunate trying to feed their families and make a living in dire times and trying to right wrongs. Sound familiar? It's Heartbreaking that we are fighting for the same BASIC human rights as we did 90+ YEARS AGO!!!
The hardships faced by Elsa are simply relentless. Kristin Hannah wrote a visceral, richly detailed and atmospheric novel that will transport us back to the Dust Bowl and to the migrant settlements in California afterward, This is such a fascinating tale filled with captivating historical detail that gets glossed over in history books, Learning about the ""company store"" and how American citizens were forced to be basically slaves to these large farmers was eye-opening to me and I felt the desperation and hopelessness these people must have felt because they had nowhere to go and no one to turn to.
By the end of this book, I cried, I raised my fist in the air.. and I also wondered Kristin Hannah has written so many great novels that one can only ponder if she can continue on the winning streak..
Her writing will break you, move you, and heal you -all at once and she offers no regrets only explanations of why, how, and when she decided to choose such subjects to tackle with the upmost of respect, dignity, and courage.
Kristin Hannah began writing this novel over three years ago, before the pandemic, before the skyrocketing unemployment that would follow. And yet, this story is so relevant to our current days, the isolation, dwindling funds, people, as she says in her note at the end, frightened for their future, men in power shushing voices in order to further their own desires, wanting us to pay attention to what they say and not what they really mean or what they show by their actions. Or, as the Wizard of Oz said: ’Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.’",5,-0.2941,Negative,364

Am disappointed in her crafted story to promote Communism, wish I hadn’t spent $14.99 to support it.",1,0.9118,Positive,26
4,Unbelievable. I sit here in literal tears... bawling. Best book I’ve ever read. Could not put it down. Continued needing to know what would happen next. My head is spinning. My words are scrambled in my head because my emotions are everything. NO MORE.,5,0.2885,Positive,44
5,"I started this book right after breakfast yesterday morning, and nust finished it. Though set in the 1930s, every face, every situation, every description,was an overlay of right now. And the question, ""are we as resilient as we were to see this to a better end for us?"". This book captured the strength and will and love that we jave as Americans, and the tenacity and courage to fight for a better way. Kristin Hannah, this is the best one yet.",5,0.9584,Positive,81

8,"Khristin Hanna is one my absolute favorite authors. Having said that, I was so disappointed with “Four Winds”. I just didn’t need liberal guilt about the homeless in America. This was a different time and different circumstances. Yes, homelessness is tragic. However the folks in this book were not the same as today’s homeless. Think about all the government help folks now days get. It was just TOO subtle political for me.",2,-0.1757,Negative,72
9,"Kristin Hannah novels are so hit and miss for me.

For instance, I absolutely loved Night Road...it's probably one of my all-time favorite books. Yet, I really hated the The Nightingale.

And here's why...

Every time I read Hannah's historical fiction, I end up feeling as though she researches like a mad woman, jots down every tragedy she can find during that time period, and then destroys her main character by making her suffer through every. single. calamity.

It's too much.

This book was so horribly depressing, and was so full of misery and death (animals included...it's bad, friends), that I couldn't wait for it to end. There was zero enjoyment while reading this. Yes, it's well-written, and yes, Ms. Hannah knows how to ratchet up the tension...but man, balance is a good thing. The constant darkness is overwhelming.

The conclusion was completely predictable and emotionally manipulative. I know I was supposed to break down into devastated tears, but instead, I let out a huge sigh and rolled my eyes. Does that count? I think I just need to stick to her contemporary books and skip the historical options.

I'm once again in the minority here, so read it...you know you want to.

The Four Winds is actually the first book that I have read by Kristin Hannah even though I have heard time and time again how great many of her previous works are. Even with all the hype, I was still very impressed by her writing style, captive storytelling, and engaging characters that the reader truly gets to know and love. At time, I felt I was living Elsa's life, personally feeling her despair, hopelessness, and strength. I had never thought much about the daily lives of the struggling American farmers and workers during the Great Depression, so this book was eye-opening and informative. It gave me a deep appreciation for the courage they displayed in the fight for their lives and livelihoods. I think it's about time I finally get around to reading The Nightingale, as well.",5,0.9665,Positive,151
11,"Kristin Hannah has long been my best loved writer but this book was such a disappointment. I found it tedious, repetitive, and downright ddepressing. The storyline plodded along and i found myself skipping whole sections..... how many ways can you describe dust, drought, wind and floods? Important time in history but this book was as dry as the Dust Bowl itself.",1,-0.1779,Negative,61
12,"This book was incredibly depressing and pro-communism towards the end. It also ended extremely predictably. The characters were one dimensional, and not very likeable. The first few chapters were decent, and it just got sad, boring, and repetitive through the rest. Wish I could get my time and money back.",2,-0.8515,Negative,50
13,"I was happy to see a new book by one of my favorite authors, but will not be buying more. Be warned that this book is a political statement.",1,0.0727,Positive,29
14,I couldn’t wait for this book from a favorite author. No more. The tiny bit of light at the end was far too small to make up for all the sadness. The notes at the end tell us her family lost someone dear in this pandemic so it appears Ms Hannah wants to be sure everyone shares her grief. We are already there. I needed something to lift me above today’s darkness and this sure wasn’t it. I can’t recommend it to anyone and will in fact recommend my friends not to read it. Unfortunately I know some have already bought it. I’ll not buy any more by her.,1,0.6705,Positive,109
15,"If I had to read one more chapter about how downtrodden and virtuous the migrants and unionizers in 1930s California were, and how evil and greedy everyone else was, I was going to scream. I finished the book because I kept hoping the last third of the story would start moving beyond how awesome Communism in America in the 1930s was, but no such luck.

I started reading this because I kept hearing how good Kristin Hannah's books were. If she's this overwrought with all of her stories, I'll pass on the others. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the first quarter to a third of the book was actually pretty well-written.",2,0.7704,Positive,114

18,"There aren't enough stars in the Galaxy to give this book. If I could reach out my arms and gather them all I would. I want to thank Kristin for writing this book of love and hope in a time that it's very much needed. As history once again finds itself with record high unemployment and scarey unknowns, this books shows us that life continues and perseverance will prevail.

A Mother's love is fierce and strong and knows no boundaries. Elsa, the girl who couldn't be loved by her family because of her weak heart and awkwardness grows up and shows the world her strength and courage. After being forced from her family for making a mistake, she learns about love and family from her husbands parents. But, when the drought hits and life gets hard, her husband wants more and leaves in search of it. Elsa once again has to pick up the pieces and protect her family. Year after year things get worse until she has to make a choice. Her son's life or the land that she has grown to love. It isn't even a question. She packs up everything and heads west along with the rest of the families in search of a better life.

Along the way she finds herself. Her strength and her courage. A purpose that she never knew she had. She teaches her kids the to be strong and she finds love along the way.

This book was so gut wrenching. Absolutely beautiful. I never wanted it to end. I loved reading about the dust bowl and the effect that it had on society back then. I loved that just because the grass was greener didn't mean that life was sweeter. The characters were written with such a depth that you could see them standing in front of you. From the red silk dress, the dust storms and the hunger, the words just flew off the page with such vivid color that had me longing for more.

It is really uncanny that Kristin started writing this book before the Pandemic. Because it struck home on so many different levels. Just the pure uncertainty of life right now. The unemployment, families struggling. It's really funny how history is always a huge part of our life and that it repeats itself in many different ways. But there is always HOPE.

I can't recommend this book enough. It truly is beautiful.",5,0.996,Positive,406
19,"I love Kristin Hannah's books. Not this one. What started out promising, just faded. Characters are one dimensional. Gaps in the back stories are never explored or non existent. There are just too many gaps in this story. The best part of her past works was the rich stories surrounding each of her main characters. I didn't care for any of the characters in this book because you never felt you had a chance to know them.

I can't tell you how many times I have reread each of her books. This will not be one. I'm embarrassed that I recommended the book prior to reading it.",1,0.9242,Positive,107

21,Absolutely hated this book. So depressing and almost TOO depressing for these times we are in. It didn’t take me long to read because I wanted to finish it and get it over with. I really like the author’s work but this was HORRIBLE.,1,-0.8896,Negative,44
22,"I know I’m in the minority here, but I have to write this review. I rarely write them except I finished the book a few days ago and it’s nagging on my mind to express how utterly disappointed I am with this book. This is my first time reading this author’s work and I only did because I am a history addict. The hype pulled me in as well, darn it! I’ll be brief. The characters were so dull and one dimensional that I thought I would lose my mind trying to discover even the smallest evidence of something more from each one. Yes, even the long suffering Elsa was painfully dull. The author used repetition unceasingly; did you know there are tumbleweeds in Texas? The only reason for adding an extra star is because I learned a handful of interesting facts about the Dust Bowl. I’m not even going to really complain about the ending because it was predictable and I was so glad to be done with the book. I felt cheated and robbed of my $14.99 when I finished the last sentence.",2,-0.974,Negative,185
23,"I agree with other reviews about her take on Communism, depressing, and not what we need to read right now. I've been a fan of Hannah since her first book and recent ones also. Our bookclub has read her last 3, but although historical in nature like Nightingale and Great Alone...this one had no hope. I've read other more accurate Dust Bowl accounts, and although tragic, it showed the strength of hard working Americans who found solutions and were hopeful for a better America...",1,0.9548,Positive,84
24,"After reading a number of Kristen’s books, I found this story to be contrived and pedestrian, superficial in the storyline and the exaggerated stereotyped characters that I didn’t want to finish reading. Without the gratuitous sexual portions, this would be a nice book for adolescents (young adults) interested in a fictitious account of the depression era and the plight of migrant farm workers.",2,-0.0516,Negative,63
25,"Poor Elsa has the worst life of virtually any heroine, so much so that most people's lives are great in comparison. Just when you think things may be improving they get worse, relentlessly so. The book is very well written and fast-paced, and yes, that old cliche, hard to put down. If you are looking for something even remotely uplifting, I don't think this book will do the job. Even the poor animals suffer horribly, which is something I wish author's could refrain from doing. It is fiction, after all, and not everything has to be depressing and horrible.",4,-0.8558,Negative,99
26,"This was a great book. I already knew a lot about the Dust Bowl, the dirty thirties and the “dusters” that plagued the inhabitants of the Great Plains during this time. I think Hannah’s description of the Texas panhandle and the horrible dust storms (dusters) of that time is spot on. I do wish she had touched on the jack rabbit and grasshopper plagues, though. The characters of Elsa, Lareda and Ant are very well developed, as are those of Tony and Rose. I understand why Elsa and her children left Texas to go to California, but I don’t understand why they didn’t go back, considering how awful it was for them in California, and how conditions were starting to improve back in Texas. But the thing that knocked a star off my review is the ending. I hated it. It seemed to nullify the entire book. This book is great as a commentary of man’s inhumanity to man and it’s also a very, very good story, with the caveat stated above. Also, if you’re interested in learning more, I can highly recommend the Ken Burns documentary, The Dust Bowl. Elsa’s hometown of Calhart, Texas is featured in it.",4,0.9441,Positive,199
27,"I bought this book probably a couple of minutes after it went on sale this morning, Feb. 2, at 12:02 a.m. Read until five a.m.! The book details the life of Elsa and her two children as they struggle to survive any way they can through the Great Depression in the panhandle of Texas. They are trapped the awful drought that created the Dustbowl of the Central plains of the US- through horrendous dust storms that bury crops and kill livestock. .Elsa, whose parents see her as an undesirable weakling, finds her strength to carry on for the sake of her in laws and her children. She and the children finally leave the farm when it becomes apparent she must take her children elsewhere or they will die from the awful conditions- driving 900 miles to California. In California, they find no welcome from the locals, and live from hand to mouth in a tent encampment as she tries to find work to feed her family.
So many issues in this book relate to what is happening in the US now, and elsewhere in the world. People fighting against the indifference of nature (Covid/drought), people trying to emigrate elsewhere for a better life and not being welcomed, the too little too late attitude of government to relieve the suffering of those displaced by drought and financial ruin.
If you think being stuck at home because of Covid with your heat and air conditioning, your full refrigerator and indoor plumbing is rough, you should read this book. I'd suggest you do an image search for ""dustbowl"" and ""Hooverville"" to see some really good photos of the era- truly eye opening.",5,-0.9767,Negative,279
28,"I did not care for this book and I really wanted to like it. It was gloom and doom from the first page and our world is too full of that at the present. A book should take you away to a good place, not one where NOTHING good happens. I tried to return it but no option for that. $15.00 for nothing.",1,-0.6844,Negative,63
29,"I’ve read a lot of Kristin Hannah’s books, her last two being my favorites. She gets better with each story. My only complaint is that I wish I didn’t have to wait so long for each new book. That’s also a huge compliment to her - I eagerly anticipate them and pre-order the minute possible. This book is such a relevant story since we’re all going through the pandemic and the past awful four years of Trump. She started the book well before the pandemic and her choice of eras to write about was really appreciated.",5,0.9422,Positive,96
30,"I say The Four Winds is better than the Grapes of Wrath for two primary reasons: 1) the main characters are women for a change and 2) the writer seems to have a deeper understanding of the economic, climatic and social factors creating such pain for the main characters. I was deeply moved by this novel. I actually cried out and sobbed at the end. I can see how Kristin Hannah was inspired by Dorothea Lange's photos of the Great Depression, especially by The Woman of the Plains. Her descriptions of the relentless dust storms on the family's farm and the dangerous drive from Texas to California will rivet you. Reading about the cruelty of most of the Californians already living there and the abuse of the big farm companies reminded me of our current mistreatment of immigrants in this century. If you were a migrant from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, or the Mid-West you were considered dirty, lazy, ignorant, contagious. The assumption was that migrants were draining state funds and taking away jobs. Hospitals wouldn't treat them. They couldn't find...or afford...housing. Eventually the state withheld relief funds altogether. Sound familiar? The migrants were forced onto disease-ridden plots of land to live in tents or in their old trucks. This happened to hundreds of thousands of Americans in the 1930s. And we didn't seem to learn much about how to treat our fellow citizens, much less our fellow human beings. Nonetheless, the main character, Elsa, and her fierce daughter, Loreda, refused to stay silent. Despite how painful the story is, you will not want the book to end. I hope Hannah continues the saga through future generations of this courageous family.",5,-0.8735,Negative,280

32,This book is so depressing with an unlikeable main character and a miserable daughter.,1,-0.7626,Negative,14
33,"I really liked this book for multiple reasons. Beyond it's being a terrific story, I saw it as a chance to educate and
inform our grandchildren and younger generations of this painful, very difficult part of American history- it really
lays out a vivid picture of how unbelievable this period of American life was. It's the stuff of movies or dramatic
stories. The heroine, Elsa, was so compelling in her love for her children, her ability to slog through terrible times of suffering to keep her little family intact to ""get to the other side"". It also shows how devastating climate disasters like what happened in this period of drought and dust storms can be. The writing was very skillful and kept me really engaged especially in the 2nd half. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 rating was because I
thought the first half was too long and drawn out. The 2nd half moved along in the wonderful way a truly good story does. I am going to get one of Hannah's other books and only hope it is as good as this one was.",4,0.9671,Positive,190
34,"Kristin Hannah’s newest book “Four Winds” gave me insight into my parents’ behavior in the 50’s and 60’s as I was growing up. It also left me feeling uncomfortable, and I wonder if discomfort was part of Hannah’s intention in writing this story. I hope not.

My parents grew up in the 30’s during the Depression and carried the mindset formed during those years for a long time afterwards. We were taught to fix what was broken or torn and not spend money to replace it. We had to turn off the lights whenever we left a room. We did not waste food. Gardens were planted, produce was canned or frozen. Credit cards were never, ever used. We girls sewed our own clothes. We had only two pairs of shoes, one for school and play and the other for church. My dad’s salary in the 50’s was only $200 per month, but we kids didn’t know we were poor. We thought that nobody else we knew went to restaurants and movies either. My mom and dad sacrificed to pay for music lessons and to take us to concerts performed by famous pianists and other musicians. Our entertainment was playing table games together every Friday night and listening to records or the radio while eating popcorn. We didn’t own a television until I was 18. We learned that we didn’t need things; we needed each other. We were loved and cared for by godly parents. “Four Winds” helped me understand what my parents went through when they were children. We were rich compared to the characters in the book.

I was angered by the injustice shown in the way poor, needy people were treated by wealthy landowners in Hannah’s book. But is it fair to characterize every wealthy person as greedy and every citizen with jobs and homes as contemptuous of the destitute migrant workers? Were all native Californians inhuman? Is capitalism wicked and negligent of the needy? This is what made me uncomfortable with the plot of the story. The author seemed to be saying that socialism is what our country needs to conquer injustice. Maybe I’m misunderstanding her intent. Maybe this is simply a story of suffering and injustice and not a treatise against capitalism. Surely the author knows that not all the wealthy are greedy and not all the poor are victims. Life is not always fair, and it is a good thing to work against injustice, but we don’t need to change basic American values in order to do that.",4,-0.9884,Negative,423
35,"“A warrior believes in an end she can’t see and fights for it. A warrior never gives up. A warrior fights for those weaker than herself. It sounds like motherhood to me.”

From the first page to the very last, The Four Winds is a story that is fraught with heartache and suffering. The author masterfully transports readers to the despairing days of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, and there is little reprieve for the reader and none for the characters. The hardship is simply inexorable. This book made me realize the extent of what a human can bear and particularly the lengths a mother will go for her children.

The Four Winds is uncannily prophetic of 2021 with its account of an America in economic decline suffering devastating and relentless natural disasters, its people holding contempt for those they deem inferior and the anxiety people experience at potentially being exposed to widespread contagions. Further, it is impossible not to make comparisons between the cruel and unjust treatment of Dust Bowl migrants with the treatment of immigrants coming to America today. In all of these ways, this narrative is monumentally timely.

As much as this is a tale of pain and adversity, it is also a story of the perseverance and dogged determination of the human spirit in the face of the worst circumstances imaginable. It is a story of the love, fortitude, endurance and grit of a mother who will leave no stone unturned for her family.

In essence, The Four Winds is the quintessential American story, and I recommend it with five stars. Don’t miss it!",5,-0.9917,Negative,269
36,"If you don’t read this book and feel compassion for today’s immigrates, then you are heartless. This story is about white people suffering the inhumanity, Indignity and cruelty of being an “other” to the communities they are forced to join. It’s the same story repeated over and over in American history. We are a cruel people to anyone different than us. Immigrants merely want fair wages for work and opportunities such as my ancestors got when coming to America...because ultimately, we are all immigrants.
This story is also about the women warriors who usually endure in silence, Mothers and daughters and their special relationship. Families and the true meaning of love.
We tend to forget our history when it’s convenient for us but this book reminds us that any one of us could suffer a natural disaster and become an immigrant to some where else. I hope this reminder serves to give readers more compassion for immigrants and those in poverty. No human should have to suffer such inhumanity in this advanced society.",5,-0.8716,Negative,173
37,"This is a historical fiction centered around the Dust Bowl. For most people today, you've probably heard of the Dust Bowl...but this books make you live it and makes you FEEL it. Hannah tells the story not often taught in school by bringing to life the struggles of the women on the farms during the 30's. If you want a book with strong female characters, this is the book for you. In this story Hannah beautifully touches on issues related to race, religion, beauty standards, gender, and class. It is powerful and heart-wrenching: it makes you sad, angry, hopeful, and grateful. It really highlights the point that those who do not know the past are doomed to repeat it.",5,0.7964,Positive,119
38,"I was simply swept away by Kristin Hannah's powerful story of the Dust Bowl and the Martinelli's migration from Texas to California. The characters are beautifully written. As they work through their difficulties, there is no doubt in your mind that the characters stay true to themselves. During this heartbreaking time in America's history, it was extremely challenging just to survive. After the dust storms nearly destroy the family farm, Elsa's husband leaves her and when their youngest child develops poor health, Elsa decides that she must be brave, pack up the car and drive to California. She doesn't know what she will find there but believes that it must be a better situation than her current one. When she arrives in California, Elsa joins the masses of migrants called Okies who pick cotton to try to feed their families on an incredibly low wage. She is a strong, independent woman who works hard to take care of her two children and another migrant family with six children that she befriends.

I know not everything ends well, and many lives mirrored this family (and worse) during the Depression/Dust Bowl days, but reading it during bleak, icy winter days in the year of COVID was not my best decision. As others have mentioned before me, the political angle was not subtle or welcomed. I guess the biggest takeaway is that this can happen again, and likely will unless we stop the division of Americans that politics have created and start pulling together in love.",2,-0.2453,Negative,94
41,"As a big fan of Kristen Hannah, I am extremely disappointed in The Four Winds. Because of the topic, it should have been a fantastic read. I found it boring, repetitive, and ""wordy"" beyond belief. The main character is as boring and invisible as she thinks she is. I actually dreaded the read and would put it off until bedtime. I purchased the book on February 3 and didn't finish it until the 9th. Not a page-turner...",3,-0.7778,Negative,77
42,"Kristin Hannah is my favorite author! The Four Winds was another well-written and obviously researched book. The heroine, Elsa Martinelli, makes her sad marital life into something that brings her happiness. It just seemed like tragedy after tragedy, and I kept waiting for life to cut her a break. While I love, love, loved, the book, the trials of this family were definately depressing!",4,0.8774,Positive,64
43,"Before reading The Four Winds I read the reviews from some of your readers. I was excited to read a book that I couldn’t put down and this was it!! From the first page to the last, I was riveted to the life of the heroine of the novel and the hardships she endured to assure that her children would feel loved above all. This is a book of courage and bravery in the face of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression and extreme poverty and the injustices faced by migrant workers in the 1930’s. I have always enjoyed Kristen Hannah’s novels for their depth, their descriptions and their character development. This is a beautifully written novel that carried me breathless at times through the hardships encountered in Texas and in California. I highly recommend this book! Once you start it you won’t be able to put it down.",5,0.9832,Positive,150

It grabbed me in the first few pages and pulled at every emotion in me all the way through the book! I learned so much about this era in American history that I had only heard about. The heroine , Elsa, is a woman full of all the things every woman wishes to be! I am better for reading this novel and give much gratitude to Kristin Hannah for sharing this story and her talents with the world.",5,0.9643,Positive,99
46,"At times, you do feel caught in a wind storm coming from four different places as the emotion can be exhausting, but the ending makes the story worth it!! I am a reader who enjoyed ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and I love ""Children of the Dust Bowl."" This story is unique because it focuses more on a feminine perspective. It's heart-breaking at times, but the sheer power of grit and overwhelming perseverance by this woman and her family is remarkable.

47,"Kristin Hannah gets better and better. I couldn't wait to get my hands on Hannah's newest release and I wasn't disappointed. This novel takes place during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl time period. It follows Young Elisnore as a child that her family rejects to her years as a new wife and mother. Elsa is struck with trial after trial and when you think it can't get worse, it does! Like all of Hannah's books, this has all the feels. Have your tissues ready!",5,0.9234,Positive,86
48,"Who are the people who survive natural disasters that result in months and then years of hardship? What kind of strength does it require to face the loss of so much that one loved and dreamed of? Finding the tenacity to keep reaching for a new and better life, while your life depends on how you just make it through today, demonstrates the determination and the courage of human kind. This story that takes place during the great depression and the dust bowl focuses on heroes who must act brave even while terrified, show acts of strength when feeling weak. And although this story takes place in the 1930s, who would have guessed we would be witnessing and experiencing such ingenuity and acts of courage in 2021?",5,0.9711,Positive,127
49,"I don't know what I was expecting but it was not this. I read the Grapes of Wrath years ago and thought it would compare to that. Some parts reminded me of Steinbeck's novel, but then this book took a turn that left me speechless. The whole ending of this book was a complete shock. I loved how they decided to use their voices and be brave. I love the constant evolution of the mother daughter relationship.
From the beginning this book had me. My heart ached for Elsa so many times. The love that her ""new"" family showed her throughout was beautiful. It is sad how much self doubt she had because of her mom and dad. Two very small chatectors but two huge parts of the story.
I loved reading this book and I will suggest it to so many friends. My only regret is that I bought the Kindle version and not the hard cover so I can share it.",5,0.9907,Positive,163
50,"As a history buff, this is one of the best books about the depression years. The story of Elsa and her family is probably typical of the survivors of the dust bowl and depression years. Ms. Hannah's descriptions of the dust storms was so realistic that I felt the dirt on my skin! Anyone who reads this book should be prepared for the myriad of emotions you will experience. It won't leave you very soon.",5,-0.5919,Negative,75
51,"A wonderful book about the Texas Panhandle during the Dustbowl era, when many families picked up and left their homes and most of their belongings, and travelled to California ""for a better life"", only to find themselves ostracized and treated like foreigners in their own country. So many parallels to what has happened in the recent past in this country! Kristin Hannah is a great writer, I always enjoy her books.",5,0.9493,Positive,71
52,"This will be a classic right along with Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. I couldn't put this book down. It broke my heart as it gave me hope for America. I thought at first reading that this was a horrible time to publish this book during this horrible pandemic, but instead it reminded me that there is always hope and together our nation will survive and be even stronger and better.",5,0.8094,Positive,70
53,"I purchased this book from Kindle because I was 11 in place at the library, and one can only imagine how long it would have been before getting the hard copy to read. It was worth every penny I paid, and I would have gladly paid more if necessary in order to read it. This book is fantastic. We had a winter ice storm in NC yesterday, and I read on this book all day long.....Kristin Hannah is absolutely getting better and better with her books. I would give this a 10 if possible! I loved the characters, loved how it grabs you on page 1 and never lets go! This was excellent....just get it!!",5,0.9703,Positive,115
54,"Kristin Hannah writes such amazing books and this one is as great as her others. So much range of emotions is present in each one which leaves the reader feeling complete as only a great book can. I put this book down as I eagerly await her next book. I say there's no way the next one can be this awesome but I know it will be. Thanks, Kristin!! You are a reader's dream!",5,0.9539,Positive,74
55,"This is not always an easy read. It takes place during severely trying times and it's hard to fathom the suffering of so many people. But it is in hardship we sometimes find our strength. This is a story of a family that is tested sorely and must dig deep to hang on to hope. It's a story of love, perseverance, compassion and courage. The story also includes the ugly- the prejudice, the judgment and greed and there are timely lessons we should remember as so many families are facing desperate times due to the pandemic. Another spectacular story by an outstanding storyteller.",5,0.815,Positive,103
56,"Having long awaiting Kristin Hannah's new novel, I anxiously began to devour it. Bear in mind I had read all of her novels. Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, the settings at first were comforting. Kristin grew as a writer. Her finest work was the epic Winter Garden.
Now we are offered The Four Winds which was quite different indeed. The setting was the drought ridden Texas Panhandle to the cotton fields of California. Elsa., the protagonist was depicted so well. One could not but find oneself feeling the depth of her soul. The constant struggles of daily surviving however overburdened me. I realize the times were very hard on multitudes of people. So certainly that was made more than evident. The saving grace for the novel was Elsa. To watch her grow into a self-reliant, brave woman was the heart of Kristen's endeavor.",4,0.9761,Positive,145
57,"I really liked the book and story. Yes, it was rather sad but well written. What frustrated me most was whoever printed this book, did not pay attention to quality. I was reading page 320 and then next page is 317. The mix up of pages goes until 346. I finally got fed up and skipped the 26 pages of a mess so I could at least continue the story without flipping back and forth trying to find the right part of the story. Again, some attention to quality would have been appreciated.",3,0.1382,Positive,93
58,"While reading this book, I couldn't help but feeling that I was re-reading parts of The Grapes of Wrath. Obviously both are about the Great Depression, the devastation of the Dust Bowl and the fragility of life. Hannah's writing, as always, is excellent. It is not hard for the reader to recall Dorothea Lange's photographs of migrants when reading about Elsa and her children, the most iconic photo being that of thirty-two year old Florence Owens Thompson, shown with three of her seven children, taken in 1936. Often referred to as “Migrant Mother,” the picture has come to symbolize the human tragedy of the Great Depression. The parallels of this book and The Grapes of Wrath are strongest when the story resides in the roadside migrant camps and cabins owned by the farmer, Mr. Welty. Regardless of how hard she works, Elsa cannot escape the power that Welty has over her and her family. While the company store seemed like a lifeline, it ultimately became the trap from which she couldn't escape. My biggest issue with the book was its glorification (intentional or not) of communism. The migrants who came to California were by no means communists, far from it. They merely wanted the opportunity to work and be paid a fair wage for their labor. It was also unclear whether any of the organizers were or had been migrant workers. It seemed they moved from one cause to the next. I think it would be futile to suggest that the ""Greatest Generation"" had its foundations in communism, quite the contrary. I think this book succeeds when it focuses on the family dynamic and the relationships between Elsa and her parents, in-laws, husband, and children, especially her daughter. Ms. Hannah has again crafted an excellent story worth reading. Is it her best, probably not, but it is by very good.",4,0.9863,Positive,310
59,"Hannah does it again. Her writing - just the right amount of description and conversation to move the story along. Not once did I have to skim through. Hannah is an amazing weaver of words, but an even more author of the human condition. My first Hannah book was Firefly Lane. I sat and cried and FELT for almost a day after finishing it. Then Night Road. Took my breath away. Now Four Winds. Here we are in these times again. The character Elsa exemplifies what we must become. We must be strong and not give up in the face of this pandemic. Thank you, Kristin, for giving us the gift of these words in these unprecedented times.",5,0.9052,Positive,118
60,"when you're an excellent author, the bar is held very high. This one missed the mark. It started out very good but drug on for the majority of the book. I found myself rereading the same page many times. I would just lose interest. Honestly, if I hadn't purchased the book, I wouldn't have finished it.
I definitely will read any of Kristin Hannah's books in the future, as all the others were excellent. Just not this one.",3,0.9509,Positive,78
61,"I gave this book three stars because I compared it to Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, which won the Pulitzer Prize and is a classic of literature, and found The Four Winds inferior. I thought the characters were compelling and realistic and the writing was good but Steinbeck, by comparison, was far superior in telling the same basic story.",3,0.8689,Positive,58
62,"Another wonderful book from Kristin Hannah. Yes it’s heartbreaking, but I don’t agree with other reviewers that say it’s too depressing with no happy ending. Sometimes life doesn’t have happy endings, and Kristin Hannah has stayed true to the time period and her research is impeccable. While reading the book I also watched the documentary “The Dust Bowl” by Ken Burns (right here on Amazon Prime! ;) Highly recommended compliment to this book.",5,0.9565,Positive,73
63,"This novel started out with a very depressing story line and it went down from there. I kept waiting for the family to catch a real break but it just went from bad to worse. Awful read.
The migrant workers treatment was abhorrent and thank god they finally formed unions to protect their rights (this is back when unions were necessary - now, IMO, many have much grown into their own form of evil). But Ms. Hannah went a bit too far with the capitalist-bashing.

To quote part of the post written by an earlier reviewer (William de Rahm):
"" I felt like I was being hit over the head with Ms. Hannah’s message about how unfair capitalism can be. Ironically, at the same time that Americans were struggling mightily to get through the Depression, Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin was carrying out his plan of “dekulakization,”—the liquidation of an entire class of peasant farmers as enemies of the state--in order to collectivize Russian farms and bring them under government control. “Dekulakization,” resulted in the death of possibly millions through starvation, disease, mass executions, and deportation to labor camps. Yet Ms. Hannah does not see fit to balance her message about the evils of capitalism with the evils of communism. Communists are heroic, capitalists are not. Yet, life is a lot more complicated than Ms. Hannah portrays.""",2,-0.9939,Negative,226
64,"Kristin Hannah is one of the v very few who just get better with each book she writes, she grows and for that I'm so grateful because I know her next one will be fantastic. I love all the characters in this book, beautifully written, felt the dirt on my face and struggle to put food on the table. Wanted to reach out and tell her that she was beautiful and strong and someday she would know that and she would know true love. Knocked it out of the park. If this is your first book by her please read The Nightingale and The Great Alone also 5 ⭐'s.",5,0.9875,Positive,109
65,"I look forward to all of Kristin Hannah's books with great anticipation, and I was not disappointed by this one. Those of us who were born after the great depression and the dust bowl really don't have any idea how difficult this time was. One thing that is clear in this book is the repetitive day in day out life on a midwestern farm in the 1930's. Another is the resilience of the folks who lived through the need and starvation and eventually came out the other side. I truly could not put this book down.",5,0.8575,Positive,96
66,"WOW! I'm lost for words right now. It's about dysfunctional families, life, struggles, over coming your worst fears and standing up for what's right. It's about basic human survival. Stay strong with your believes and never stop regardless of all the road blocks ahead. LISTEN TO THE WHISPERS AND FOLLOW YOUR GUT.",5,-0.489,Negative,52
67,"the story started out pretty good. i was so glad i bought this book. well, i'm about to just say: can't do this anymore!
the characters are just boring and if i read one more page about the brutal weather conditions, i'm going to scream!
really, 5 star people...what are you thinking? i gave it 2 stars only because i really liked the beginning",2,0.7679,Positive,64
68,"Well, I’m struggling with what to write. I found the book to be depressing and really hard to read, but I couldn’t stop reading, and, in retrospect, I needed to read it. I needed to get through every part of it to get to the final chapters which made it all worth it. If even a small measure of it is factual, it was really something to read what our ancestors went through to survive the Great Depression. The writing, the description of the land and the people, the characters, the ending..... a really really good book.",5,0.5204,Positive,97
69,"I enjoyed learning more about what life was like in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. I loved the Italian culture of the family and I could appreciate the main character’s longing for love.
All that being said, Communism is portrayed in a positive light, and I have an issue with that. I wish the author had not taken that bent but had continued the story some other way. I’m 3/4 done with the book and am not going to finish.",2,0.9022,Positive,82
70,"I was drawn into the story of Elsa who as a child was tossed aside because of lack of beauty , but in the end is a heroine who displays courage even when she had to pretend. It's a story of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl and the tremendous pain and heartbreak suffered by those whose lives were forever broken , but not diminished .
This beautifully written narrative will have you feel the heat, taste the powdery dirt , and live the pain of a mother whose love is limitless even when her courage isn't. Read this story and be changed giving hope at a time we all need it. The plot twists and turns and keeps you guessing, but in the end the heroine's transformation will leave you breathless. I feel that I am a better person for reading this masterfully written prose. Wow!",5,0.9479,Positive,148
71,History never gives details like the ones in this story. Pictures evoke a lot of the hard living during the depression and then the addition of the Dust Bowl stories are almost overwhelming. Everyone should read this book.....now during this awful pandemic. It will give strength to all.,5,-0.7587,Negative,48
72,"Maybe this wasn't a good book to read during a pandemic. I thought it was more depressing than Laura Ingalls Wilder's The Long Winter! And The Dirty Thirties lasted more than just one season. I did enjoy the characters, particularly the daughter Loreda who was fourteen when the storyline finally seemed to get moving. Unfortunately, the book was nearly 75% done by then. If I were making a movie of this book, I would tell the back story in flashbacks rather than a linear past to present.",4,-0.7711,Negative,87
73,I am a longtime fan of Kristin Hannah and was even more impressed when she moved to historical fiction with the Nightingale. The Four Winds is also beautifully written. Hannah deeply researched this tragic era and then made it come alive in details that transported the reader. The strong female characters made me root for them... and cry for their heartbreaks. I could hardly put the book down and when I did the story still occupied my consciousness. There are many parallels to challenges we face today..My only criticism is that the dialog at times seemed inconsistent as it moved between expressions congruent with the early 1900s and others that fellt too modern for that time.,5,0.4522,Positive,116
74,"Just finished The Four Winds today! WOW! Amazing, outstanding, and an awesome masterpiece. Felt like I was there. Almost could not breathe and a few times crying so hard that I had to put the book down. Now that I am done, all my words feel scrambled in my head. Tying to find the words to say thank you for writing another great book. I have learned a lot more about history and women in history through your books, then I ever did in history class.",5,0.9804,Positive,86
75,"A very readable but dark book about a very dark time in our nation’s history that still continues somewhat today. While I appreciated the development of Elsa’s character, I would have liked to know a little more of why she was treated so badly by her birth family other than what she thought those reasons were. The ending was too abrupt for me. But I thought the author did a good job of recreating the Dust Bowl and the migration west, and how devastating the Great Depression was. Would recommend this book...but be prepared for a sad story about a sad time in American history.",4,-0.5479,Negative,105
76,"I read a lot and it's been a very long time since I read a book in one day. The subject is entirely relevant to our lives today. Kristin Hannah is really a great storyteller. My only criticism is that her editor could have done a better job, but that's a minor point. What matters is the story and she really pulls you into it. From many points of view, it's America's story and if she gets us to pay more attention to it, she's done her job.",5,0.3047,Positive,88
77,Excellent story set in a difficult time in our history. Els has the same grit as Cora in The Great Alone or the Nightingale. Powerful strong women. Determined to do what is right no matter what. Loved the book and it will be one of the best in 2021,5,0.9675,Positive,49
78,"Unfortunately this was like a one-dimensional cartoon book trying way too hard to be fiction. It needed better editing ... there were almost the exact same sentences within pages of each other and long sections with no purpose of additional character development or moving the story forward. It also bothered me that current buzzwords like ""fierce"" and ""warrior"" and ""found her voice"" were used as historical speech but are really sound bites for today's audience. There could probably be a drinking game for every time a character says ""... This is America ..."".

One of the reviewers said ""contrived"" and I'd go with that. Need a Depression Era book ... read The Grapes of Wrath. For a strong woman and/or bound of mother/daughter there are better reading choices.",2,0.5647,Positive,128
79,"I sit here with tears in my eyes after finishing this exquisitely written account of the Dust Bowl and the family who migrated to California to escape it. I had no idea of the impact that the dust storms of the 1930s had on farmers from Missouri to Texas, having never read Grapes of Wrath. Googling every date and incident, I recognized how thorough Hannah’s research was. It’s a depiction of abject poverty, hopelessness, familial love, and the resilience of the human spirit that triumphs in the end.",5,-0.2263,Negative,88
80,"This book was really hard to put down. I kept hoping that things would get better for the woman but it doesn't. I remember my mother talking about hard times during the Depression, but never heard about many of the situations these poor people had to endure. Whenever we feel that life is too difficult, read this book and everything is put in a different perspective. Hannah once again tells a fantastic story!",5,-0.7869,Negative,73
81,"My father was born in 1921, this story, which I know is a work of fiction. The struggle of life than, well it gives me more of a sense of appreciation and love for the things that people went through. This book was difficult to read, not because of the writing. The story was amazing the writing fabulous. It was knowing that the struggle was real!! Thank you Kristin Hannah for an amazing story!!!1",5,0.9594,Positive,74
82,"I thought the story was interesting and moving. The characters and the land came alive. I kept reading to the end but I found part of the story depressing- I’m sure it was very depressing for those who struggled during those times. However, Elsa’s life seemed so awful at times - specifically the way her parents and sisters treated her.

That being said, it was well written and moving and I read to end.",3,-0.8551,Negative,74
83,"The story was riveting and I thoroughly enjoy Kristin Hannah books. However, this brand new hardcover book was missing several pages about 3/4 of the way through the book around pages 348. There was ink smeared on several pages and then duplicate pages were inserted around pages 353. I have never seen this before and obviously something happened during the printing/production process. Such a shame, as I really wanted to finish the engrossing story, but was afraid to order another in case it came from the same Amazon stock. Appreciate Amazon accepting my return for a full refund.",1,0.864,Positive,98
84,"This is a wonderful book,I couldn't put it down. It's about the great depression and is so relevant what we are going through today. Every bit as good or even better if that's possible than the Nightengale (same author), it's over 400 pages long and I read it in 3 days and got nothing else done. This is a heartfelt book so excellently written. It made me cry and I very rarely cry over a book",5,0.9554,Positive,76
85,"The Great Depression is a time when Americans were beaten down, then they rose up. During WWII and every day since. The land, the immigrants, the work ethic....all is on full display in this wonderful book. I loved it!",5,0.8002,Positive,39
86,Phenomenal! I’ve been reading Hannah since I checked Home Again out at the Library in 1997. One of my cherished and favorite authors; she never disappoints me. This novel was heartbreaking but yet gave hope at the same time. Elsa is truly a warrior. Loved reading her story from a “spinster” to a mother protecting her children til her dying breath. Really puts life now in perspective.,5,0.9567,Positive,67
87,"I loved, loved, loved this novel. I read that some reviewers said it was depressing. To me it was a lesson on how during strife and difficulty how brave and resilient the human spirit can be. How you rise above it and how the author stated on numerous occasions “through your fear you can still prevail.” I loved her characters and how each one was weaved into this wonderful story.",5,0.9646,Positive,70
88,"I’ve read quite a few of Kristin Hannah’s books. I LOVED The Nightingale. When I saw Jenna Bush Hager have this book as one of her book club reads I purchased the Kindle edition right away. I had not read anything about the drought/dust bowl. How could people live this way? Yet I felt like I was with them in the trenches. Superb writing, amazing characters...be brave.",5,0.9609,Positive,67
89,"I really enjoyed the novel, except for the fact that my copy has repeat pages and missing pages. This is not the author’s issue but the printer’s, yet it affects the flow of the novel nonetheless. Hence, three stars.",3,0.6628,Positive,39
90,I am a huge fan of this author but not of this book. It was well written but such a depressing story. First Elsa’s unhappy upbringing feeling unloved. Then the farm she comes to love belonging to her in-laws blows away in the dust bowl years . Then the westward migration to California and living in unimaginable poverty and squalor. I really didn’t enjoy reading this novel.,3,0.5814,Positive,67
91,I hesitated about reading this book because of the subject matter. Thought in these times it might be too heavy. I’m so glad i decided to read it. Read it in two days. It was about the sacrifices one makes for family. It showed the strength of women during these times. Would definitely recommend. It’s been a long time since a book made me tear up.,5,0.8769,Positive,66
92,"Good book though hard to take all of the hardships. This really opened my eyes to the era in which it took place. I kept questioning whether I could have survived those times with the back-breaking setbacks and heartbreaking disappointments. It's completely shameful that anyone should have to live in such conditions (the squatter camps). As is the case in any Kristin Hannah book, character development was stellar and historical facts were spot on. Grab some hankies and settle in for a beautiful, yet tragic story.",5,-0.4927,Negative,86
93,"This took my breath away. I finished it in two days. It had heart, soul, passion, and compassion. I first thought I would wait to read it, but I picked it up and couldn’t put it down. I learned so much history and luckily I have my 95-year-old dad who remembered so much of that era. Kristin Hannah...you touched my heart. Thank you.",5,0.9643,Positive,63
94,"I was disappointed in this book. Yes, Kristin Hannah takes us through the remarkable journey of survival during one of the darkest times in American history. But, it just wasn't an enjoyable read. Of course the topic is depressing so not the right choice for a book to lose myself in. I didn't have that ""ah"" moment at the end.",3,-0.8767,Negative,60

I relAted be cause my mother had told me of so many tales of her and my father's trip across the U S right after they were married and working in the Hop fields and Orchirds jst to get to their next destination. I cried thru the end of the book so much true that happened in our history,5,0.5233,Positive,72

This one was especially heart wrenching because my family lived through the dust bowl times, times of need and want so desperate that my heart bleeds from remembering my parents telling of it.

I ordered the Kindle version but now want to purchase a hard copy to pass down.,5,0.2263,Positive,54
102,"Powerful message, beautifully written and couldn’t put it down. It’s a novel of the meaning of perseverance and family. I also appreciate Ms. Hannah’s deep dive into the time period in our country and it piqued my interest and desire to learn more about it. My favorite read of 2021
so far!",5,0.9617,Positive,52

I’m from a farm on the Great Plains yet learned so much about the Great Depression and Dust Bowl from this book. I would love to be able to talk to my ancestors who lived through what the Martinellis endured.

I will be thinking about Elsa and The Four Winds for a long, long time. Fingers crossed it will be a movie someday!",5,0.9493,Positive,105

107,A true look at the dust bowl during the 30s followed by a journey to the land of milk and honey. That became the land of poverty and no money. The only way to make things better is to stand up for yourself. The heart of warrior. Have Kleenex close you may need them. Loved this book and author,5,0.8519,Positive,59
108,"Slow to start. I wasn’t sure if I would keep reading. I didn’t believe the Cinderella premise of the main character. When the author began writing about the Dust Bowl history it became interesting. As one reviewer said, there is a lot of tell instead of show.",3,0.6124,Positive,47

110,Four Winds is an essential book for younger generations who know little about the Dust Bowl and the Depression.

I felt I was with Elsa every step of the her journey. It was a book of relationships and believing in yourself to do the right thing. How we treat others with money and those with none?

114,"I just finished this book and my tears are still close to the surface. Kristin Hannah has a god-given power to have you live a catastrophe such as the Dust Bowl (that I have never given much thought) and the people that survived with their wonderful will and grit.

180,"This book is depressing. It touches me because I never ever wanted to live the life of a farmer who’s life existence is at the hands of the weather. How do you survive a drought for over four years, a Great Depression of the whole country at the same time. The government forgetting about the farmers plight. When you can’t scratch a crop out of dust and dried up dirt. When your children have no shoes and a potato for their lunch, if you can find one. When trying to escape, to save your children from the sickness of constant dust storms, you go to a new life only to be shunned by those more fortunate, as dirty and disease ridden. You are shunned and looked down upon. You aren’t part of the more fortunate who have running water, shoes and clean clothes. When you are forced to live in a tent and work 12 hours in a field for fifty cents a day. When your only reason to keep fighting for survival is your children.
The strength of the farmer is beyond belief. The love of the earth even if it doesn’t respond because of the elements. This book is very well written and speaks of a time I only heard about from my grandparents and that was from the point of view of the small business owner in a small town during the Great Depression. The fortitude of Elsa and the children was amazing. Growing up without love but with affluent parents Elsa was forced into farm life, but it became her love and existence, until the years of the drought. Her fight to give her children a better life, an education a future of successes was amazing.
Thank you Kristen Hannah, NetGalley and St. Martins Press for allowing me to read this ARC I didn’t enjoy reading it only because it was so true of the hardships experienced by that era of the farmers life in the Great Plains it hurt my heart. I also felt proud of the fortitude of Elsa and strength it took to do what had to be done no matter the pain, shame and loneliness it brought. It’s up to you if you’d like a book like this.

243,"The Dust Bowl during the 1930s was the worst environmental disaster in the US history, accompanied by the collapse of the economy and its effect of massive unemployment, resulting in massive migration of people from the Great Plains and other parts of the country to California. California was advertised as the land of milk and honey. Was it so?

Texas, 1921. Elsa Wolcott is twenty-five-years-old. She was a sickly child forced to stay home and not able to finish her schooling. Within the comfort of her own room, she continues to take adventures from the pages of her books she devours. At her age, she is considered a spinster and unmarriageable one as declared by her mother since men desire attractive women and Elsa is not.

Dalhart in Texas is part of the flat, Great Plains stretching as far as eyes could see, “a sea of prosperous land. (…) … A gold mind of wheat and corn.” Despite the Great War, Dalhart experienced “booming economic times.” This “making everyone in town rich,” including Elsa’s father. Thus, he doesn’t understand why she needs education for when she asks to attend college in Chicago to study literature.

1934. “Four years of drought, combined with the economic ravages of the Great Depression, had brought the Great Plains to its knees.” The land is bone-dry, completely useless, people are hungry, and animals are lethargic, men feeling useless and unhappy leave families and head west to California.

Loreda Martinelli, Elsa’s daughter, dreams about leaving the dry lands for something bigger and more exciting. Loreda’s best friend is leaving for Oregon with her family and she has to stay behind, because her mother refuses to leave the land she loves. She despises her mother for not wanting to leave this godforsaken land.

It was interesting to read about FDR’s plan to help farmers and about farmers being stubborn and proud resisting FDR’s plan which was an utter nonsense to them. They needed water; they didn’t need charity and someone to tell them that they misused the land.

The hardship and the effects of years of dust and drought are vividly presented. When farms are transported “into a sea of brown waves,” after dust storms, you can see it and also feel the dust between your teeth and in your eyes. The dust getting to people’s lungs and causing them dust pneumonia. Them being left with nothing to provide for themselves and forced to migrate west where there is promise of jobs.

It’s heart-wrenching to see people going through hardship due to natural causes and combined with economic disaster. They follow the path where promises are made of a better life. But as it turns out they’re not welcomed there anymore. They are mistreated on the fields and out of the fields. The hospitals are only for Californians who pay taxes and not for dirty Okies.

When someone who has very little to pretty much nothing shares whatever little they have with their neighbor is heart-warming. And tries to explain all the injustice to a young mind. “When times is tough and jobs is scarce, folks blame the outsiders. It’s human nature. (…) In California it used to be the Mexicans, and the Chinese before that,” and now it’s Okies from Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

Elsa is a character that your heart goes to. She looks for solace in books when dealing with overbearing parents. What she lacks in nature, she finds in the novels – “to be bold, brave, beautiful, if only in her own imagination.” She loves her husband and craves his love, but as she’s been told from the childhood she is not pretty and that’s the reason. Her daughter despises her, because she doesn’t have dreams. But Loreda doesn’t know about her mother’s childhood and how her dreams were squashed by domineering parents. Loreda dreams of becoming a writer and Elsa recognizes herself in her daughter. Thus, she wants her daughter to go to college, to pursue her dreams and to be happy.

271,"I’m not sure I’ve ever waited so impatiently for a book to be released- or been as disappointed as I was in this book.
It’s bothered me for hours since I finished it.
One part of me thinks that there is just NO way Kristen Hannah wrote this- it didn’t even FEEL like one of her books.
I’ve read books from this author since way back in her contemporary romance days and I’ve re-read Winter Garden, The Nightingale and The Great Alone many times and they are too me three of the best books written in the last 20 years —
But this book- The Four Winds was so stiff, flawed and manufactured that it was honestly hard to get through.
At one point I was so disappointed, I almost said a prayer that it would get better.
The book was eerily similar to a another book I read about a woman’s true account that was documented from letters and journals from years and years ago when she really did live through the dust bowl.
At times it reminded me of another book The Worst Hard Time.
But throughout the book, I felt that she couldn’t finish a page without a history lesson. I’ve read the nightingale enough times to know that I didn’t get a break down on WW2 politics every other sentence.
There was NO main character to this book.
The main character was Politics and the weather.
Literally....
By the end of the book, I still didn’t have a mental picture in my mind of any character- I couldn’t even tell you what Elsa was suppose to look like other than “maybe ugly with stringy thin hair?”
More words were used to describe the help of the communist and the description of the dust -over and over and over- than went into the mind or heart of any character who came on the scene.
I stared at the last page for a good 30 seconds like WTF did I just read??
And I hate it because this lady can write.
I don’t know what happened with this book.
And I couldn’t even feel anything for the characters at the end because I never got to know them at all in the 400 plus pages before she closed up the book in a really strange and awkward way.

The thing is- This author wrote about Stalin’s rule and the plight of a woman from Russia with such precision that her book Winter Garden cut through my heart like a knife.
To then lay out the story of a Freedom fighting sister in the Nightingale while equally telling the story of the other sister with an inner strength that was unmatched and take me into occupied France as if I had been transported there- or carry me off to Alaska in the back of a Vw van and into the Bush with a family in the Great Alone that I will never forget—Yet completely lost me in a book about America during the Great Depression.
If you want to read a history lesson about the dirt, poor farming practices, dust pneumonia, selfish people, while basically being told that communism was the only help for the poor people in California or that the leader of the communist instigators at that time would get bashed over the head and while bleeding would tell a woman to grab his mic and keep talking while the big bad capitalists wolves with all the money gunned the people down and beat and killed them- then here is your book.

276,"Wow! When you read a book
written by Kristin Hannah you know going into it, you will meet people who have strength, courage and true grit ! A book that will teach you, stay with you, and writing that pulls you into the story , and for the entire book you are there, with the characters, their families, their struggles and the triumphs.
Elsa is born into a rich family who doesn’t know her, and doesn’t love her. She has this desire to be loved. She wants a life where she can be judged on more than her appearance. When she meets Rafe she mistakes his lust for love and when she becomes pregnant and her family disowns her, it is Rafe’s family that takes her in, and Rafe marries her. Elsa grows to love Rafe but Rafe constantly wants a better life than being a farmer in Texas.
Rafes parents become the parents Elsa never had, hard-working farmers who fall on very hard times. The hard times become way too much for the couples youngest son, and he has to be taken out of the dust bowl that has become Texas, and they migrate to California hoping for a healthy and safer life. That is not what they get .
I love this family, this family went through so many hard times, so much pain and suffering, all they had was their love for each other.
This is a book about America and about migrant workers. This is a book about the farmers and the hard times that befell Americans in the 1930s, The Great Depression and the fallout from the stock market crash.
I loved Elsa, she had more grit and courage than she ever thought she had.
I am a huge fan of this author and I love that she writes of strong females and lives that don’t break them but make them stronger and mold the generations after them to be just as strong .
A huge 5 star “ don’t miss “ read!",5,0.9965,Positive,338
277,"If you are interested in the story of the Dust Bowl, read timothy Egan‘s “The Worst Hard Time“ for an in-depth account of the disaster rather than this woke love letter to Communism. Or if you are interested in Okie plight, read Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath.” KH can turn a phrase, so I gave it two stars. Unfortunately most of the characters lacked any dimension (bully cotton farmers, evil police, hateful parents/sisters, clueless protagonist, bratty daughter). In her desire to portray Communism (with a capital C!) as an American Value, she demonizes capitalism at every turn. Ironic considering the farm system resembled the enforced communist labor camps we see today in China.",2,-0.908,Negative,112

281,This story is one that will stay with me for a long time. The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is rich beautifully crafted storytelling. It breaks your heart and leads you to the darkness of a past that you never knew existed. Yet it's merciful enough to provide just a sliver of love and hope necessary to keep you from despair. The author doesn't sugar coat the story at any step of the way. The main character is strong and loving. As the reader you know this from the beginning even though she couldn't admit it to herself til the end. Historical Fiction lovers will relish this book for its description of daily life during the depression and dust bowl eras. As the reader your heart goes out to all the characters and their terrible predictions. It never occured to me that American migrants were treated so badly in California. It brings light to an ugly little American truth. I became so invested I would of loved the story to simply continue. Perhaps a new story that follows Loreda and her adventures.,5,0.9743,Positive,182
282,"Wow. Just wow. I feel like I just finished reading a plagiarized version of ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" only Elsa and her family were Texans, and not Okies. I had anticipated reading this novel months prior to its publication date. I feel let down and disappointed by Hannah's cobbling together of a Depression/Dust Bowl/Land of Milk and Honey story. For a more compelling account of the Great Depression/Dust Bowl/Land of Milk and Honey, I suggest reading ""The Grapes of Wrath."" There's a reason why it is a classic, which is something ""The Four Winds"" will never become.",1,0.9425,Positive,97
283,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is a wonderful, heartbreaking, epic journey and is an excellent historical fiction novel. This novel will grip you from beginning to end. Once you start reading, you will not be able to tear yourself away from the stunning plot. You will forget your job, your responsibilities, your family...just kidding, but you will definitely be absorbed into this complex, intricate journey of a young woman coming into her own and overcoming the large amount of obstacles thrown her way to find her way to redemption. Do yourself a favor, and read this book.

The main character is Elsa Martinelli and she and her children live in a very difficult time and era: 1930s Midwest (Texas). The time of the post-stock market crash, down and out economy, the dust bowl center of the US, and in the center of this, Elsa is trying to eek out a living in a rural area with less then stellar results. Her choice in the end: does she take her children to California in order to find a sliver of a chance at survival, or does she stay with the sad, decreped land that she inhabits now which has thus far resulted in poverty, scarcity, and emotional emptiness?

Elsa has been through so much growing up, a difficult childhood, growing up too soon due to necessity, marrying into a loveless match, but being able to have children that she loves, and the eternal hope that somewhere, somehow things can be better.

I loved Elsa. She is strong, she has fire, she has gumption, she has a foundation of love and forgiveness for others despite not being afforded that in her past. She does not realize how strong and intelligent she truly is. She is a force to be reconned with. I love that she fights for her family and her children's future. I love the independence. Is she perfect? Nope. Does she always make the best choices? Nope. But who does? And those imperfections make me love her even more. Her journey is hard, it is remarkable, it is brave, and I cannot lie and say I did not tear up every now and then while reading her story.

I am not going to lie, this is not an easy read. There is pain, there is heartache, there is not always justice. It is a difficult time for many people and the odds are stacked against the characters, but the fortitude and the drive is what draws you back to the story again and again.

An excellent read from an excellent author.

5/5 stars Truly a gem.",5,0.997,Positive,437
284,"I am a huge Kristin Hannah fan. I have loved so many of her books. This one is an achievement in the technical aspect of writing. I felt every wrenching emotion I was meant to feel. But at this point, I must tell you something. This is not an uplifting book. Occasionally (very occasionally), there's a beautiful interlude thrown into the midst of despair. But that doesn't happen often. At first, I was disappointed because it felt like this story was a rewriting of John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath."" Why was this very capable author rewriting a classic (that most of us have read) about a subject that in and of itself is so depressing and sad? Finally, in the last half of the book, I understood. It took a different turn than Steinbeck's did. And while some people might not appreciate the message, it was apt for the time and circumstances. America has a history that we sometimes can't be proud of. We always look back from the distance of time and think, ""We will learn from this. We won't treat people like that anymore."" And yet so often, we are doomed to repeat history in ways we later wish we hadn't. There were a couple of implausible things in this story, especially toward the end, that brought my rating down to four stars. But I can recommend this book easily. Just be sure to read it when you're in a good mood. And let's try to learn from the mistakes that were made during an unfortunate time in our history. Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for the opportunity to read an advance reader's copy. I'm impressed.",4,0.3775,Positive,281
285,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah follows the strong female protagonist as she struggles to lead her family through the Dust Bowl and beyond. It is hard not to fall in love with the bravery of Elsa Martinelli in the first few pages and quickly find yourself rooting for her until the end.

Hannah has personified the struggles that each member of a farming homestead would have felt during the Dust Bowl from the strong patriarch grandfather to the youngest son. My heart broke for them as they struggle with a loss and separation. I loved seeing each character gain strength over the course of the book.

While this book did not capture the scenery the same way that The Great Alone had, Hannah did capture the struggle that is the American Dream, especially for a family that starts from nothing. This book left a few tears in my eyes, and sparked my curiosity to read more about this period of time.",4,0.9628,Positive,162
286,"That’s the only word I can use to describe this 465-page novel about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. If you’re interested in that period, and what it was like living through it, then this may well be the book for you.

Elsa grows up in the fertile Texas Panhandle during the 1910’s and 1920’s in a solidly middle-class, very comfortable household. But due to a childhood illness, she is kept sequestered at home by her parents who repeatedly tell her that she has no prospects for marriage or a career. Yearning for adventure, she sneaks out of the house one night, meets a boy, and becomes pregnant. Her family throws her out. She marries the boy and moves to his family’s small farm and slowly gains acceptance, bearing two children and working hard as a farmer’s wife. When the Great Depression and the land-ruining Dust Bowl hit, Elsa and the entire family begin one long, painful slide into hell. Eventually, her husband having left her and her son suffering from “dust pneumonia,” she packs her children into their truck and they make the perilous drive to California—supposedly a paradise with plenty of work—only to find themselves hated and shunned as “Oakies.” Working for pennies a day picking cotton, struggling for survival, preyed upon and victimized by greedy owners of large farms, Elsa and her children fight back via the movement to unionize California farm workers.

While the “The Four Winds” is a very well written historical novel, as you would expect from Kristin Hannah, it is not an entertainment. Indeed, it’s not just set against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl; it immerses the reader in all the hardships of the time: the years-long drought, the ruination of the land, the boiling summers, the freezing winters, the dust storms so severe that dirt pours from the rafters, the crushing poverty, the inability to purchase even the simplest convenience, the hope that tomorrow will be better, the bitter disappointment when it is not. So if you’re not ready for a novel about unrelenting disaster and hardship, this may not be the novel for you

And it’s fairly political, hitting many of today’s progressive themes: the wisdom and courage of women, the cruelty and weakness of men, the evils of capitalism, the greed and wickedness of property owners, the promise of Communism and its credo: “From each according to [their] ability, to each according to [their] need.”) Indeed, by the end of the novel, Elsa has fallen in love with a union organizer who is a self-proclaimed communist. (Actually, he’s much more interested in providing workers a fair wage than he is in overthrowing democracies.)

All in all, it reminded me of something that might have been written by John Steinbeck or Theodore Dreiser or Upton Sinclair or even Charles Dickens. So, if you enjoy those authors and their social commentary, you may well enjoy this.

But I did not find the experience enjoyable. I found some segments repetitive, others melodramatic and message-oriented, and others entirely predictable. And, a lot of times, I felt like I was being hit over the head with Ms. Hannah’s message about how unfair capitalism can be. Ironically, at the same time that Americans were struggling mightily to get through the Depression, Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin was carrying out his plan of “dekulakization,”—the liquidation of an entire class of peasant farmers as enemies of the state--in order to collectivize Russian farms and bring them under government control. “Dekulakization,” resulted in the death of possibly millions through starvation, disease, mass executions, and deportation to labor camps. Yet Ms. Hannah does not see fit to balance her message about the evils of capitalism with the evils of communism. Communists are heroic, capitalists are not. Yet, life is a lot more complicated than Ms. Hannah portrays.

So, while I respect a lot of what Ms. Hannah has written, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it.",3,-0.9954,Negative,659
287,"A historical fiction novel set in The Great Depression told from the female perspectives of a warrior mother and her courageous, teenage daughter. The lovely and engaging writing of Kristin Hannah weaves together a tale that's both incredibly sad and indelibly hopeful.

This is a story of downright hardship, pain, and despair. Yet, it's one of survival; what it takes to survive not matter the personal, emotional, and financial cost. It's of one woman with a heart full of love whose need to protect and guard her children play on your heartstrings and remind you of the absolute resilience of the human spirit. It's a story of bravery. Courage that you can't even see but find a way to muster for those who hold most dear. It's a story of grit and fight when it's recognizable but more importantly, when it's not and how to come to see it.

That's my most personal take away from this book. The strength and fight of the human spirit. Of a woman’s unbreakable spirit, her powerful voice, her enduring love. That strength, specifically, of a Mother. But, also, that of a daughter of such a warrior woman. These two females have much to teach us about the bond that connects us and the bravery we gain from the connection and how to use that power. And how much we learn from each other and how much we evolve from those teachings. This book, through it's many obstacles and such grief, reminds us of that resiliency of spirit and what we can learn from it. It reminds us of the power of love and the many forms it takes and how often we take advantage of it yet it always remains. And I think, especially now, that's a message worth reading.",4,0.9937,Positive,297
288,"I just finished The Four Winds by Kristen Hannah and feel as if I’m living in the old Soviet Union. This book reads like a propaganda piece. It literally romanticizes Communism using one of the worst times in American history to bestow Communism’s great illusions. Kristen Hannah owes it to her readers to write a book about the food shortages, food lines, rations and corruption of the communist elite. She needs to write about Soviet lives, Cuban lives, Chinese lives, Venezuelan lives that have been taken by the Communist governments. If you want to read a book about the Depression and the Dust Bowl, stick with Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck.",1,-0.1779,Negative,111
289,"5 easy stars for The Four Winds! I knew The Four Winds by @kristinhannahauthor was going to be a quick read within about 30 pages. I started thinking about what a fantastic movie it would be because of how easy it was for me to be swallowed up in the setting with the characters. The way Kristin describes the heat, the earth, and the life struggles of the main character, Elsa is gripping. The dialogue and depth of internal feelings of the main characters sprouted empathy that are difficult to find in books, portrayed by words.
Elsa thinks she is destined to live a loveless life. A change in circumstances and twist at the beginning changes all of that and she is quickly thrust out into the world with practically strangers. The strangers take her in and love her in ways she has never felt from her own family, filling voids she thought would always remain. Multiple twists, turns, and devastating blows later, this story shows the significance of the love of family and the power of relentless hope.

This book contains parallels to the trying times we are in. Thrust into lives much different than we had pre-Covid19, I felt it encourages us all to find the hope Elsa clings so tightly to throughout the book, the hope that is very American, with the capacity for overcoming difficult times and holding on to dreams and aspirations we all collectively share with grit that only comes from consistently putting one foot in front of the other, day after day.

I recommend The Four Winds. If you like Kristin's other books, you will surely want to add this one to your collection and crack it open asap. If you aren't familiar with her other writings, this one is a great one to start with. @oakcitybookreviews #fourwinds #5starread #bookreviews #readgoodbooks #historicalfiction #greatread #sendmebooks #bookaholic #readtolive #lovebooks #booknerd #nerdalert",5,0.9886,Positive,316

Set against the backdrop of one of America’s most defining eras...the Great Depression Ms. Hannah brings Dust Bowl migration to life in her riveting story of love, courage and sacrifice. “The Four Wings” tells how Elsa Martinelli worked hard to care for her children Loreda and Anthony when her husband Rafe abandoned them. With her children, Elsa left the Texas farm for California...the land of opportunities...but what the family lived through was not what they had wished for....

This historical fiction is one that whisked me away into another time and place not only with its uplifting read but also for its richness of words and excellent portrayal of the American Dream seen through the eyes of a strong-willed woman whose actions will change the life of generations to come. What a great timing for this book being published during the pandemic a time when workers are out of work and some are losing all they have. During the depression people had little or no help at all from their governments.

This is heart-wrenching and a tear jerking story from the opening page till the story warps up. Close to 500 pages of a very exhausting read. What we have are pages after pages of griefs, suffering, tragedies, despair, hunger and most of all the feeling of powerlessness.….. and a story of the ultra-rich taking advantage of people in need...sounds familiar. Plus ça change plus c’est pareil. Well said...well-done.

At the end of the book Ms. Hannah tell us that she took writer’s liberties in enhancing her narrative to make reading most pleasant and she did it with finesse and excellence...

291,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is a very highly recommended historical fiction epic set during the Great Depression.

It is 1921 and Elsa Wolcott lives in the Texas Panhandle. She never felt love from her family and longed for something more, certainly love, but also acceptance and a place to belong. At the age of 25, she decides to take a chance, leaving her home one night looking for... something, she meets Rafe Martinelli, a young 18 year-old man who is also restless and the two make a connection with each other. After a few late night clandestine meetings, Elsa is pregnant, her parents throw her out, and she and Rafe are married. She lives on the Martinelli homestead, learns to cook, clean and farm, and to love her new in-laws, Tony and Rosa.

Then the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression hit the Great Plains. It is 1934. Foreclosures are rampant, crops are nonexistent, people are starving, livestock is dying, and the land is blowing away without rain. Elsa and Rafe have two surviving children, Loreda, 12, and Anthony (Ant), 7. Rafe, who has becoming increasingly distant and a hard drinker, leaves one night for California, abandoning his family. The Martinelli's struggle on until a decision must be made. Elsa takes Loreda and Ant, with Tony and Rosa's support, and they head to California to look for steady work and a better life. But California is not the land of milk and honey and the dream is a nightmare. The immigrants, or Okies, are discriminated against and taken advantage of, making their lives even more precarious.

Following in the tradition of Steinbeck's classic, The Grapes of Wrath, the historical time and setting in The Four Winds has been thoroughly researched and masterfully presented. Hannah does an excellent job setting her novel in the time period and describing the hardships they endured. The plot is well paced, covering the hardships in Texas and California and the narrative is compelling. I was engrossed in the story, both in Texas and California. There was no good choice during these desperate times and the whole gritty reality is clearly presented in totality as we follow one woman and her children. The backbreaking work for very low pay as migrant workers in California was heartbreaking and the treatment of these Americans who were just trying to take care of their families was despicable.

Elsa is, ultimately, a strong woman, but she has so much self-doubt and self-loathing that she has to overcome a lifetime of self-debasement in order to become the strong woman she is in the end. Loreda is a horrid teen, but also changes, becoming a mature, confident young woman after she experiences and takes note of the disparity of the treatment of people. When she is told, ""They call you names because they don't want to think of you as like them"" it was a truth that holds on today when people from the Great Plains are still called disparaging names and put down by people from California, as well as the east coast, with no acknowledgment that we are all Americans and, in light of the pandemic, we all need jobs.

Many of us who had ancestors live through this time period have heard the stories of hardship and sacrifice they endured living through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. Some basic things they did during this time as a matter of course have survived right up through my generation. (Washing and reusing all plastic containers, foil, saving anything that might be useful for something.) But we were also taught to work hard without complaint and to put family first. It is a pleasure to read such a well-written novel that shows the self-sacrifice and determination of those who survived the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, in spite of the forces against them.

292,"This is a story about the Great Depression in the US in the 1930s, of hunger, desperation, misery and greed. It’s mainly, however, a story of strength and resilience and indomitable will in the face of unimaginable horror and misery. This is what makes it such a powerful read in today’s times. It reminds us that history repeats itself, that people can triumph over whatever is thrown our way. So ultimately it’s a book of hope.
Elsa, abandoned by her wealthy parents when she falls pregnant, finds love and purpose when she goes to live with her new husband’s Italian family. She grows to love the land and her in-laws. When her husband abandons her, Elsa must overcome life’s challenges and be strong for her children, beautiful, headstrong Loreda and little Ant.
And then nature turns against the Great Plains, cruel and unrelenting, plunging great swathes of land into drought and famine, transforming once rich farmland into a dust bowl. There’s talk of jobs and plenty in other parts of the country, and eventually Elsa joins the constant flow of migrants seeking opportunities further north.
I loved how Elsa grows throughout this book. Her parents never showed her love and shaped her distorted view of her own worth with their criticism and absence. Elsa tends to make herself disappear; to become invisible. But when she has to fight to look after her children, she finds her strength, and as she overcomes challenge after challenge she finally steps into the shoes of the woman she really is. She finds her voice. Her strength and courage are incredible.
I cried buckets reading this book. Probably because the pandemic makes me more vulnerable and tearful, but also because Kristin Hannah writes with such clarity and intensity that she transported me right into that time of soul-destroying despair and hopelessness. I ached for Elsa and her children, and all the others living in appalling conditions and being used by greedy farmers who needed workers to pick cotton or fruit.
A beautifully written book that will resonate with so many readers. As Hannah says in her note, “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the Great Depression would become so relevant in our modern lives, that I would see so many people out of work, in need, frightened for the future.”
Highly recommended.",5,0.739,Positive,390
293,"Kristin Hannah has a very large fan club of which I am a member. I have read most of her titles and loved them. The many people who read her books know that she will bring us into the story and make us care about the people and communities while we watch their story unwind. Ms Hannah grabs the reader on the first page and pulls them into and along while she educates us too. This book takes us into a desperate era in the Midwest. I live in Oklahoma and no matter how bad the Dust Bowl era sounds in the book, it was worse. Whole families and their history was lost in the few years it took to clear the land of every scrap of arable soil. This history is an integral part of our state's story, as children, we learn it well. Ms Hannah has done an excellent job of conveying the hopeless and despair brought to a whole section of the nation and how the options of so many were limited to joining the exodus to California, where their way of life would be forever changed.

As a child of a family of ""means"", Elsa should have had a wonderful childhood. Instead, she grows up in the shadow of her sisters with an overly critical mother. When Elsa meets a young man who treats her well and seems interested in her, she sees her escape into a life where she is appreciated and cared for. With love and care, she blooms and grows. Then comes the Depression and the Dust Bowl, a time in American history that still has echoes into everyday life as farmers have changed the way they take care of the land. This is not a ""happily ever after"" ending. It is a book that shows no matter the hardship, a family with love at it's heart can survive and build. At least 5 stars and an A+ for the history lesson.",5,0.976,Positive,329
294,"Elsa lives a life of privilege but she is still in a terrible situation. When she ends up pregnant, her family kicks her out and she moves in with her new husband and his family on their farm. Elsa has no experience in farm life or a family quite like this one.

When life once again takes a terrible turn, Elsa digs deep for strength and makes some tough decisions. After the last dust storm which nearly killed her youngest son, Elsa decides to leave the only true family she has ever known. She loads up her kids and they strike out for California.

Elsa is one tough lady. She struggles to feed her family, to show love, and to just plain survive. She does what it takes. Sometimes it was even too much for me to handle. I would have to set the book aside for a minute and just breathe. My heart goes out to the people who lived during this time period.

Well! I think I have already read the best of the year for me! It is going to be tough to beat this one! What a wild ride this book is. Every emotion you could have…it is experienced within this story. I cannot imagine going through what these people went through.

295,"In her book The Four Winds, Kristin Hannah has written another heartbreaking historical fiction novel that educates as well as entertains. The story of Elsa Martinelli's journey from unloved daughter to underappreciated wife and mother to brave warrior standing up for justice is beautifully told. While the story is difficult to read at times, it is worth it.

Elsa Martinelli and her children can no longer survive in the dust storms of Texas, so she packs them up and heads west in the hopes of finding work and a home in California. What she finds instead is discrimination, unfair wages, unlivable conditions, and back-breaking labor. Add to all this an angry daughter who challenges her constantly, and you end up with a woman almost completely beaten by life. However, Elsa finds the strength to keep working in an attempt to provide for her children.

This book is hard to read, not because it is poorly written or boring but because it is so incredibly sad. It contains one sorrowful event after another. Injustice is followed by more injustice. After surviving hardship in Texas, the characters face worse hardships in California. While reading, I kept hoping to see something good for these characters, but instead there was just more sadness. Honestly, I almost stopped reading it because it was depressing me. I kept reading, though, because I was invested in the characters.

Kristin Hannah is talented at developing characters. Each main character in this book (Elsa, Loreda, Jack) is vividly depicted. Elsa and Loreda's emotions are believable and understandable in their circumstances. The reader develops real sympathy for them.

This story is one of survival, bravery, and love. The characters persevere through the worst of circumstances, and they do so without losing sight of who they are. They stumble at times and almost give up or stop believing in themselves, but they fight their way back and find a way to keep going. Love is the one constant that helps them through it all. As Elsa states in her journal, ""Love is what remains when everything else is gone."" Love for her children is what makes Elsa a warrior in this book, fighting for a better life for them. She ""believes in an end she can't see and fights for it.""

I did not love every second of this read because of the sadness, but in the end I recognize the beauty of this book. This tale is well-crafted and teaches some valuable lessons. It also educates the reader about a very grim time in history. I would recommend this book to all Kristin Hannah fans and any historical fiction reader that appreciates a well-researched and well-constructed story. Just be prepared to be emotionally impacted.",4,0.9645,Positive,454
296,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah
Book starts out with a listing of the author's other works, dedication and prologue where we learn about the penny that has hope for one's new life in US.
1921 and we start out in TX and Elsa has been raised to be very poor in health so the parents keep her safe at home.
Her sisters are beautiful and are married and out in the world. Elsa wants to be more like them so she does a few things to her hair and dress and spends the night at a speakeasy where she meets a boy.
She meets him more over time and before you know it she's with child. What I hated to read was that her father dropped her off at the boys house for them to take care of the daughter and child.
She was from a very well to do banker family and knows nothing of preparing meals and doing chores. She is thankful to learn how to do everything.
Rafe is tired of TX life and the droughts cause him to just up and leave to head to CA. They don't hear from him and the youngest boy needs to be relocated for his health so she packs up the kids and heads west also, leaving the grandparents behind.
Terrifying hearing of the nights spent on the road and passing through the desert. When they reach CA things are not what they expected and Elsa is NOT afraid to work. She meets a wonderful woman in camp who gives her information about how to survive.
She did scrub a woman's house from top to bottom til 6pm one day and got 40 cents. She puts the kids in school and while searching for work she tries to also find Rafe.
Fell in love with this side of CA during the depression reading about it from John Steinbecks stories so to me this is an added plus to continue on with the story coming from a different irrespective.
Hard times hits them front and center and just when you think they are getting ahead you realize they are not. They realize it also and the daughter goes to do something about it.
So many emotions and I love hearing of the travels and the places they went through on their way to follow their dreams.
Tragic times and love hearing about how they survived through it all. Love hearing of the strikes during the time as the land owners were in control and could set the price of a picker for the day...
Never saw the ending happening as it did but was so glad Ledora gets to bring it all full circle and move on with her life as she gets older.

297,"Riveting. Amazing. Stay up all night to finish while trying to read through tears. That’s the kind of book this is. Author Kristin Hannah has found a way to help readers move out of our current 2021 lives, filled with all manner of confusion and unknown, and placed us in an even more unpredictable location. At once more distant, yet somehow well-known, the Dustbowl during the Depression had so many problems but with even less help available. Hannah has crafted characters that are so realistic I could almost sense their presence. Her tale is powerful and moving; we may know the ultimate historical outcome but the specifics are fascinating. This is a wonder of a book.

298,"Many thanks to NetGalley and Pan Macmillan for a free Advanced Review Copy of this book.

I've read books by Kristin Hannah in the past, and she is a writer who never disappoints. This book is so powerful that I'm still choking on the dust. The narrative was that realistic. The world building and character development were done wonderfully.

As you can imagine, with this book being set from the 1930s onward in the Texas Dustbowl and through the Great Depression, this is no easy read. It's heart-wrenching, but in a good way. The courage, love, and hope shown are uplifting even while the events were so horrific for so many families. For sure, the author highlights both the exceptional cruelty and prejudice as well as the unprecedented compassion and generosity of strangers. And the bravery.

The main character, Elsa, is feminism personified. And in the midst of betrayal and anger and prejudice, she shows such strength of character, stamina, and love. As well as her bravery and steadfastness, she is also celver and patient. The character arc is excellent. And we live Elsa's journey right by her side as she finds her way from the depths of despair and zero self-esteem to finding and owning who she is at heart.

A couple of lines especially struck me:

'There was pain that came with constant disapproval; a sense of having lost something unnamed, unknown.'

and

'You know the thing about history, Elsa? It's over. Already dead and gone.'

Much love and research has gone into this novel, and in the current times of hardship from a global pandemic, many of us can relate to the loss and pain written with such care within these pages.

I heartily recommend both The Four Winds and the author Kristin Hannah. I give this book a solid 5 stars.

299,"The Four Winds is a pivotal novel by renowned author Kristin Hannah. This story begins in 1921. There is a boon in the Texas panhandle after the success this area had with growing grain for the war effort. Businesses are thriving, farmers are having record crops, and life is looking good.

However, Elsinore (Elsa) Wolcott, on the eve of her 25th birthday, is distraught at the future that is unfolding for her. Having had rheumatic fever as a young teen, she is treated as an invalid and only has an isolated and lonely life living in her parents house in her foreseeable future. She asks to go to college and is swiftly met with denial. To take a moment to live out some of her own dreams, Elsa sneaks out at night to sample the speakeasy and flirt with life.

Striking out for herself, Elsa encounters the handsome young Rafe Martinelli. Rafe is out to sew his wild oats before heading to college, the first of his family to do so. After several encounters together, still harboring no thoughts of him caring about her long term, the unthinkable happens, and Elsa’s future is forever changed when her mother realizes Elsa is with child. That night, Elsa is told to pack her belongings. Her father then takes her and dumps her at the Martinelli farm.

This is the beginning of an epic journey for Elsa and the Martinelli family. As they endure the Great Depression, the major midwestern drought and the effects of the dust bowl, Elsa proves her disowning parents wrong on every count. And when the only choice is to escape, Elsa finds the strength to make sure her family can survive. All the while, Elsa hears her beloved grandfather tell her to be brave. Perhaps this is the best legacy she can give her children.

This story is well researched, beautifully written, and so reflective of our current times it is heartbreaking. So much of this story is mirrored in the events of today. As the saying goes, if we don’t learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it, and Ms. Hannah is a wonderful history teacher. Having begun this book well before the events of 2020, the timing of this release is perfection. I have been captured by each of the books by Ms. Hannah that I have read, but this one, this character, will be here with me for awhile. I very much enjoyed this book and wholeheartedly recommend it!",5,0.9702,Positive,415

Elsa is a unique character. She is the product of a racist and unbending family and the trauma of her childhood gave Elsa a skewed sense of what love is. Told she was unattractive and too tall, too thin, etc she had very low self-esteem and expectations looking forward. Thinking she was unloveable, she had no expectations and only knew hard work. Steely determination carried her through the hardships. She hardly thought of herself as courageous, but she was.

She falls wildly in “love” with a younger man (I put that in quotes, because she doesn't know what love really is until later in her life.) For her trouble, she is shunned and driven out of the family.

She, however, finds a true family in her husband Rafe's mother and father Rosa and Tony. They live on a huge farm in Texas and mainly grow wheat. The land is everything to them and it becomes so for Elsa. Rafe doesn't agree. He is a dreamer and he teaches their daughter to dream as well. This causes problems with Elsa and she becomes a teenager.

The draught begins. For several years there is very little or no rain. The crops die, the dirt blows ceaselessly. The animals die, the land dies. Hope is lost. People begin to move West.

Elsa and her children join the trek to California but it is not the paradise they expected. They find homelessness and hardship. Living in a tent city, begging for scraps, they inhabitants treat them badly. They can't even get help at a hospital in times of emergency.

This book is remarkably well written and plotted. The characters are very real. I can see the conditions for myself as Ms. Hannah's descriptions are so vivid and colorful. Elsa was difficult to like in some ways. I felt compassion at her upbringing and extreme anger at her birth family. What horrible people! But she was fiercely loyal. For someone who never finished high school, she was very intelligent and determined to do right by her children. I decided in the end that I liked her.

301,"This book had me in tears several times! Kristin Hannah books have a tendency to do that to me, and it was fun explaining to my kids why tears were spurting out of my eyes randomly today! The Four Winds is quite a gorgeous novel, a near perfect mix of family, devastating trauma, travel, history, and strength. Once you start you won’t be able to put it down!

Elsa Martinelli spends most of her teens being shut out and put down by her family, until she makes a choice that finds her thrown into a completely different life, that of a farmer’s wife in the Great Plains of Texas. There are years of abundance, followed by years of drought, of dust storms, and of pain, and Elsa finds herself at a crossroads where she must choose whether to leave, and follow the roads to California, or to stay and face a long, slow, dusty death.

This is a part of history that I haven’t really studied as much in depth as I have others, and I found Elsa’s story super insightful. Of course we have all seen photos of the Depression: images of dire poverty and of helplessness, but also images of strength and resolve. I love how the author took this very dark period in US history and turned the story of one family into the story of many. While California seemed to promise a step out of poverty, migrants instead found themselves in the same dire situations as they had at home, except this time without even a roof over their heads. This, in addition to the fact that California residents treated the migrants terribly, farm owners/growers used their dire situations as a way to pay them way less than they were worth, and federal relief was an absolute joke, created a deep hole that people could never dig themselves out of.

I know everyone uses The Grapes of Wrath to refer to this period of US history, so it was really nice to read about this time from a woman’s point of view, with several women protagonists. Obviously this is fiction, and there are elements that have been changed/modified in order to fit the narrative better, but all in all it works really, really well. There are a few areas where I wish the author had dug into a little deeper (the period of abundance is swept over, and I really wouldn’t have mind if the novel had been longer and contained a little more backstory on Elsa’s first years of marriage, and I would have loved to have more information on how things changed after the strikes and riots in California), but overall this is a really great read. If you love historical fiction this is definitely one for the TBR!

And, because of everything that happened in 2020 (and that is still happening today), it is really interesting to read about this period of dark history during another piece of what will soon be also considered dark history.",4,0.994,Positive,503
302,"Lindas Book Obsession Reviews “The Four Winds” by Kristin Hannah, February 2021, St. Martin’s Press

Kudos to Kristin Hannah, the author of “The Four Winds” for writing such a powerful, poignant, captivating, dramatic, thought-provoking, and memorable novel. The genres for this novel are historical fiction, family drama, and women’s fiction. The timeline for this story is between 1921 and around 1934. The author describes the dramatic characters as complex and complicated. There are a comparison and symbolic relationship between the land, the family, and the people. I love that Kristin Hannah shows courageous and brave women, and mothers, who show love to their families and the land.

In 1921, just after World War One, the authors describe the wonderful bounty of the land and how farmers are doing well. Elsa Martinelli is constantly reminded by her parents that she and her ideas are not good enough. When Elsa is thrown out, she is welcomed by her lover’s family and gets married. Elsa loves her two children more than anything and works and respects the land that provided food and money for them.

As the dust storms, and the land doesn’t provide sustenance or life anymore there is much anger and frustration. Elsa’s husband no longer can deal with anything and leaves. Elsa stays with her in-laws and children. The draught and the sand storms bring illness and financial ruin. The Dust Bowl era joins the Great Depression. People leave going to California for a better life. Elsa is shocked that they aren’t welcome. Picking cotton and fruit seem to be a way to barely survive.

Elsa has tried to find a better life for her children and fights both the land and the people that take advantage that keeps her in poverty. Elsa tries to show her children that they have to stand up for what they believe in. She shows that they have to be strong, believe, and have courage.

I appreciate that the author describes the importance of working together, the importance of family, friends, love, hope, and fighting for what you believe in. I would highly recommend this amazing and memorable novel.",5,0.9938,Positive,355

I Liked:
*Kristin Hannah is an auto-read author for me. She does it again with The Four Winds and wow, this is a heavy read. But like the amazing writer she is, she makes you feel despair, desperation, fear, loss and eventually hope. This story is a hard journey into a bleak time during American History, the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era.

*Not only does this book make you feel – it places you in the specific time and place so you can be there in person, struggling with Elsa and the Martinelli’s. I was praying for rain to help them! I was pleading for her daughter to give her mom a break. I was begging them to take the government help. I was enraged at the discrimination and poverty they experienced in California. Kristin Hannah always does research for her books and it shows! It’s why I love her books so much.

*Elsa is our main character and she is a girl who just wants to be loved. She’s been ruled by fear and rules all her life only to be discarded by her family. But does she survive? Hell yes…she does everything for the love of her children. My god, her mother’s love is heartbreaking and enduring. Her daughter Loreda is a strong force in this story as well. She is carefree like her father and is at an age where she fights her mother on everything. It’s a long road for all of them, but mostly for these two and their relationship.

*This story is so multi-layered. There are so many themes in this book: motherhood, pride, discrimination, poverty and survival.

Random Notes:
Triggers: poverty, discrimination, depression

*This story is pretty bleak and depressing. There isn’t much happy times at all in this book.

Final Thoughts:
Kristin Hannah once again weaves an emotional tale of brutal struggle and hope. The mother-daughter relationship in this book hit me hard, especially at the end. Elsa Martinelli’s journey is one of courage and strength and I wished so much life was kinder to her. This is an inspiring story to remind us we can get through hard times and no matter what, love endures.",5,0.9855,Positive,368
304,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is the story of the Great Depression and one family’s fight for survival. The story begins in Texas, 1921 when 25 year old Elsa Wolcott spent most of her time indoors, deemed too weak to venture outside by her overbearing parents. She is now considered unmarriageable until fate steps in and with one act of rebellion, Elsa’s world is turned upside down. Her act of rebellion leaves her married to Rafe Martinelli, a young man she barely knows and begins life on a farm she knows nothing about. Fast forward to 1934, the world is in a deep depression. Millions are out of work and a devastating drought has ravaged the once bountiful Great Plains to a wasteland. Everyone is faced with a choice: stay or take a chance on a better life elsewhere. Elsa is determined to stay on the land she has come to love. But when a horrific dust storm causes her young son to become gravely ill, she has no other choice. She packs her two children and takes the perilous journey into California. What will she find there? Will it be a land of plentiful? Will they find a way to survive?
Growing up I knew my maternal grandmother lived on an Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression. Once I sat down with her and talked about her experiences.I have never forgotten what she told me. Her stories were in my mind as I read The Four Winds. It is a story about love, heroism and hope during a time when all hope seemed to be lost. The Four Winds is a story about the will to survive and a hope for a better future. It was a time of crisis and the harsh realities that divided the people and the battle between the haves and the have-nots, the powerful and the needy. Images from John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath (1939) also came to mind as Ms. Hannah described the conditions these people had to endure. It is also the story of a woman who thought she was nothing but discovers she is someone important. I had a love-hate relationship with Elsa and many of the characters. But they felt real with real flaws and made life and death decisions. The end was truly beautiful, a tear jerking moment, a thank you to those who fought and endured the Great Depression. I recommend The Four Winds.

305,"Kristin Hannah is one of those authors who always manages to pull me directly into her stories in a quick manner. She is a master at world building and setting a tone. In The Four Winds she hooked me on page one.
The Four Winds opens with Elsa, a formerly ill girl who has grown into an entirely unexceptional woman. On the cusp of her twenty-fifth birthday she is now solidly destined for spinsterhood. But, despite her rigid upbringing and judgmental parents, Elsa does have a streak of strength far below her submissive demeanor. One daring decision is all it takes to set her on a path that will both challenge her and show her true resiliency.
The Four Winds is a story set against the great depression and the dustbowl migration when poverty spread across America and people were forced to make hard choices in an effort to survive. Elsa finds a new life on the farm of her husband’s family. But when the drought and failing crops force them to follow a promise of a better life, she discovers that California isn’t the escape she’d hoped for. Despite every adversity, Elsa proves herself stronger than the sickly little girl her parents saw in her. She’s got a ferocious will to live and will face any horror and suffer any injustice to survive and secure a better future for her children.
Kristin Hannah has done another magnificent job of setting the scene and reaching out to grasp every emotion in your body. Every one of her books leaves me an emotional wreck and The Four Winds is no different. While Hannah does a great job of capturing the essence of the setting and time period, there’s a slow build in the story line as we travel with Elsa from her parent’s home to the farm and through the drought. Despite the slower build, it’s a fantastic and emotional journey. This is perhaps the bleakest of her books, simply because it’s a true reflection of what people endured during this era. What a great story about resilience, love and hope though.

306,"This is another gut-wrenching, tragic, fantastic story on the determination and perseverance of the human spirit by Kristin Hannah!
We travel with Elsa and her daughter and son in the mid-1930s from the dust bowl farmlands of Texas where they've endured the Great Depression, drought, and Elsa's husband's desertion of his family to California, where they hope for a better life. They're forced to leave Elsa's in-laws on the farm, but have heard promising things about jobs in California.
When they arrive, the ""migrants"" or ""Okies"" are treated like animals, forced to work for less-than-poverty wages and to live in camps not fit for humans. It's a tragic, depressing, and, unfortunately, real-life part of American history.
Elsa, like others, does what she can to keep her family safe, and fed. I talked with my dad about this piece of Californian history that I hadn't heard of, since he was a 4th-generation-born Californian in the early 1930s. He remembers seeing the awful migrant camps, remembers that being called an ""Okie"" was the worst slander, and was lucky enough to be raised in a family that had enough money to survive the Great Depression.
It's such a haunting story of the human spirit and all they endured. A story of determination, perseverance, and kindness. Yes, kindness - shown in many ways through characters in the story. Those living in the camps who look out for each other, help each other, and people who are fighting for a Union to represent the farm workers for a wage that will keep them from starving to death.
It's another heartfelt and heartbreaking historical fiction must-read by this author!

307,"This is my third book by Hannah and she is such a phenomenal writer it is ridiculous. The Four Winds is set in the period of The Great Depression, and we start in Texas, at a dangerous time when a severe drought hits and many are forced to up and leave for California where a better life awaits. The plot revolves around Elsa Martinelli, a protagonist like none I have seen in a while. She is resilient, tough, and has not had it easy by any means. This is not a time period that I would ever desire to live in, and Hannah is kind enough to remind me of this with Elsa’s situation, the farm she lives on with her husband and his family has entered a drought, the Depression is in full force, and here comes the Dust Bowl era. It is the worst of times. Elsa must make a choice, does she stay and suffer or risk it all for California, where everyone seems to want to go but the journey will not be easy?

You must know that this by no means is a happy read. It is depressing, gut punch after gut punch, and you start to wonder if you are going to make it through along with these characters. But then you realize that Hannah has created yet another masterpiece, and you feel like you are there with them, suffering with them and you just want it all to be ok for all involved, but alas. This was phenomenal, and Elsa is one tough woman that I will not soon forget. The choices she makes for her family are not ones I could make. The fact that she could make them given her less than ideal childhood show her character even more. And the ending? Absolutely fantastic. Add this to your tbr if you have not already.

𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘎𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘈𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦 let me down a bit, and her new book, 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐅𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝗪𝐈𝐍𝐃𝐒, falls squarely in the middle of the other two. I flew through the story of Elsa, a Texas woman beaten down by life.

Through much of this Elsa acted in fear and insecurity (driving me a little nuts), but she had two children she needed to save, so Elsa fought her way to a different life. The relationship between Elsa and her daughter, Lareda, was where 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘍𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘴 truly shone, making me enjoy the second half of the book much more than the first. As circumstances and Lareda pushed Elsa out of her shell, I liked her character so much more. I also found this book to be a wonderful history lesson in an era I don’t know as much about as I should. Though obviously very different, I saw many parallels between then and now: unprecedented times, huge populations of people falling into poverty, finding new ways to survive, and hanging on to the hope for change. Elsa lived all that. At its heart, 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘍𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘴 was the story of a mother’s fight to protect and provide for her children and in that it was a great success.",4,0.9868,Positive,279

Kristin Hannah's latest novel, three years in the writing, has released at a time when the USA again faces the greatest adversity in decades. Set largely during the Great Depression in the dust bowl of Texas, we follow Elsa Martinelli and her daughter Loreda, as they struggle in their individual ways, to forge a better life and future. The novel opens in 1921, when Elsa has the great fortune of escaping her family due to a scandalous pregnancy, landing her in the family of her heart, the Martinellis. In spite of their dashed hopes for their son Rafe, the Martinellis find over time that Elsa is one of the best things that has happened to their family. She works hard, loves the land as they do, and manages to fully embrace their way of life, and their family, after never fitting into her own. She and her daughter Loreda struggle as Loreda hits her teenage years, when Rafe, as was all too common during this era, abandons his family. The story of how Elsa and her children, Loreda and Tony, seek a better future is both stirring and heartbreaking. The mother-daughter relationships in this novel are poignant, as is the story of how Elsa finds her strength and voice.

Kristin Hannah has a gift for giving us stories of strong women. This novel is timely, coming deep into a pandemic that has derailed lives and fortunes.

The audiobook is narrated by Julia Whelan, who also narrated Hannah's novel The Great Alone.

310,"4.2. This book is very well done but extremely heartbreaking and tragic. I really liked Ms, Hannah's The Nightingale, but found The Great Alone lacking. This is in the middle. A little hard to get engaged in the very beginning but got better as it went on, likely due to the subject matter and extreme difficulties the characters faced from a sad upbringing for Elsa (from a wealthy town family) the main character, and the perils she, her husband and his family and their children faced in the Great Depression from the drought and destructive dust storms and elements encompassing the Texas Panhandle, going from a good life to poverty and starvation, to the trip out west to Califirnia to find steady work where they were exposed to more poverty, loss and additionally discrimination as 'migrants.'. With all of the dire consequences and fierce struggles to survive with which the characters had no control, the novel shows how compassion, fierce determination, resilience, and love can triumph. There are similarities to The Grapes of Wrath in the story being told, and Kristin Hannah does as good of a job as she can. This is not a novel for the faint hearted as it is difficult to digest, yet it is a realistic historical fiction of what transpired during the Depression for many families from all over the country.

311,"An easy 4 stars for a book of courage in face of soul destroying poverty. Four Winds is the story of Elsa Wolcott and her marriage to Rafe Martinelli, after she becomes pregnant with his child. She is disowned and shunned by her family because of this forced marriage to someone they regard as lower class. She moves into the Martinelli home. Rafe's parents welcome her as one their own in 1921 rural panhandle Texas.
But then the drought comes and crops no longer grow. This period is now known as the Dust Bowl. Rafe's holds on for a couple of years, but then deserts his wife and 2 children, leaving a note, saying he is looking for a job. Elsa stays for another year, but when her son Ant almost dies from a silicosis lung infection caused by a dust storm, Elsa decides to go west.
She arrives in California's San Joaquin Valley. She ends up picking cotton at wages that keep her family in perpetual debt and poverty The story of her struggle to provide for her family is inspiring, but truly depressing.
Two quotes: ""Poverty was a soul destroying thing. A cave that tightened around you, its pinprick of light closing a little more at the end of each desperate, unchanged day.""

""Love is what remains when everything else is gone. This is what I should have told my children when we left Texas.""

312,"I finished reading The Four Winds several weeks ago, but have been unable to formulate the words to express how good this book is. Elsa Martinelli and her family live during the Great Depression, and the trials and hearaches they experience seem almost too debilitating to survive. From the lack of rain contributing to the inability to raise crops to eat and sell, to the difficulty to breathe in the dryness of the air, you will experience the feeling of these hardships with Elsa. From the impact of the wind on the environment, to the desolation of the land, you will feel Elsa's pain as she and her family must decide what they must do next to survive. From the unforeseen hardships they experience once decisions have been made, to the friendships and enemies they make along the way, you will root for Elsa and her family, marvel at her strength and cry with her in despair. Overall, this is a sad book but an amazing one. You will feel that you are right in the middle of the Great Depression with Elsa and others, experiencing both their hopelessness and their hope along the way. You may not always agree with some of the decisions Elsa makes along the way, but you will understand they are made from a place of love, hope and strength.

313,"There are just some characters so special that they stay with you long after you read about them.

I will always remember Elsa Martinelli. Hannah’s writing and development of Elsa’s character was breathtaking and so special that I felt I lived through her suffering, sadness and small joys as I read this book. Though a fictional character, she embraced and embodied the strength of every woman and mother who wants to protect her family.

For the Martinelli’s, the American dream is to work hard, and never ask for a hand out. They believed that working the land would always provide food on the table, and roof over their heads. Never did they expect how their land would bring them so much hardship.

The story is set during the depression where America was not only in a financial crisis, but also in the midst of an ecological and environmental catastrophe. Years of drought and poor farming practices caused an erosion of the top soil causing dust storms killing people and animals. This has forced farmers to foreclose on their properties to migrate west - to the land of milk and honey, California.

What the migrants experienced instead were horrific as they were treated as outsiders, experienced poor working conditions, denied basic services, and suffered hardships.

The Four Winds is immersive, well-written, a masterpiece, and by far the best from Kristin Hannah.

I highly recommend and cannot be missed.",5,-0.9679,Negative,237
314,"Kristin Hannah’s books are designed to be savored. They are not meant to be read quickly before moving on. The writing is too good to miss the intricacies of the characters and the nuances of the story that are woven within.

The dust bowl and its consequences had a much further reach than people realize. The extent to which people would demean themselves for a few coins to buy food is vividly portrayed. The horrors that Elsa and her family endured are made that much worse as they become the norm. Poverty, homelessness, hunger and unsanitary conditions that are hyper annoying in the beginning are not even noticed once they family assimilates into a community.

Four Winds will hit you in the heart and stay there. It is unforgettable. The story is told with such clarity, the reader feels as if they are experiencing life’s incredible lows along with Elsa. In doing so, it is hard to understand how she can be so positive while we are feeling devastated.

Kristin Hannah has an amazing ability to bring historical events to readers that are immersed into the story until they can’t help being moored by the characters and circumstances. This book is just as good as The Nightingale, The Great Alone and Winter Garden.

This book is the fourth or fifth I have read by this author and it's definitely my favorite. I fell in love with the female lead character right away in this historical fiction novel as you couldn't help but want to root for her.

The story takes place in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl Era. Elsa and her family are experiencing the same hardships as so many other farmers from that time period. Fair warning, this is a bleak and depressing read and it was very similar to the reading experience I had with Laura Ingalls Wilder's book, The Long Winter, in which I kept asking myself how much more can these poor people take? But before you are left with the impression this is a total downer of a story, it also presents the opportunity to witness characters' strength, grit, determination, courage, etc. in doing what they could to survive when the odds were certainly stacked against them.

A terrific idea by the author to feature this time period in her book. You can actually see quite a few parallels between the story and things going on in this country and around the world in recent years.

Elsa is a character worth knowing and I highly recommend this one if you are a fan of historical fiction novels.

'Be brave. Or pretend to be. It's all the same.'

This is a well written piece of historical fiction, set in Texas in the midst of the Dust Bowl years. The main character, Elsa Wolcott, is unloved by her wealthy parents as a child and forced to marry when she 'gets in the family way.' This changes all the plans and dreams the Martinelli family had for their son, Rafe, but they manage to find a way to welcome Elsa into their home on the farm and she works hard to earn their love and respect.

But nature takes control of their future: the rains stop and the drought years begin and just never seem to end--year after year of brutal heat and winds, dying crops, dying hope. Up until this point, they'd had 'faith in the essential kindness of our planet.' But now they were seeing its cruel side. Should they leave and join the ever growing hoards heading to California to find work? And what will they find there?

This book is a tough read, so very emotionally wrenching. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong! But the character development here is extraordinary. I won't soon forget Elsa Martinelli and her family--most especially their courage, strength and love.

317,"Kristin Hannah is one of those authors whose book you know you will love no matter the subject or genre. She’s that good at bringing character, time and place to life. Her research is dependable which lets the reader “live” in times too hard to fantasize, while appreciating the beauty along the way.

She’s done that again with Four Winds. Here more than ever, Hannah gives us a glimpse of the lives and expectations of women in the pre depression era, then raises the stakes by putting her underestimated character, Elsa, on a Texas panhandle farm immediately before, and then during, the dust bowl. Elsa and her children keep descending the societal ladder and eventually find themselves as homeless migrant workers in California.

I don’t want to spoil the story but must elaborate on the brilliant descriptions of the time and place. I could FEEL the dust in my nostrils. The cold wet nights of homelessness. The despair of hopelessness. And most importantly, the strength that Elsa finds within herself.

If you’ve missed Hannah’s other historical novels, you owe it to your hungry reader self to pick them up. Four Winds is the most recent, but only the beginning. Brava, Kristin Hannah!

Lacking the beauty of her sisters, she’s a young woman who has never known the feeling of being loved as her wealthy Texas family treats her coldly. Hope for happiness is found with a young farmer whose family shows her kindness and welcomes her once the couple marries. Elsa adapts to the hard working life on the farm and learns the meaning of love once she becomes a mother. But the Dust Bowl in Texas combined with the Great Depression makes life unbearable. Many families head to California with visions of a better life. As we know from history, what awaited those who migrated west was poverty, sub-human living conditions and alienation. But the hope for a better life still survived.

Heartbreaking, poignant, beautiful, sad. The Four Winds, the latest book from Kristin Hannah, is all that and more. It is a bleak story about a time in history where nature was cruel but people were even crueler to those simply trying to survive. It’s hard to read about so much suffering but Hannah does justice to those who lived through this period. And she shows that amidst all the hardship and despair, strength and resilience prevailed.

Then the dust storms start and everything the family has worked for starts to blow away.

Thanks to the publisher for the ARc. This might remind you in spots of the Grapes of Wrath- the theme is the same- but it's distinguished by Hannah's writing style and the focus on women.

Hannah has outdone herself with this amazing piece dust bowl historical fiction set in Texas & California. This is an era I've not read much about, only one other book previously (I liked it!). This is a gripping story that kept me thinking about it when I wasn't reading, reading when I probably shouldn't have been, & always anxious to get back to the story! With amazing attention to detail and a knack for writing graphic descriptions, I learned so much and was blown away by what I was learning. The strength, tenacity, and fortitude of the characters in this book goes beyond measure. The story touched me deeply, disturbed me often (in a good and thoughtful way that made me appreciate what the people who went through this era dealt with), And we'll stay with me for a long time! I wish I could say it had a fairy tale ending and I won't give anything away but, I sobbed. I was literally crying. The ending was still beautiful and appropriate, coming full circle... But not in the way I had hoped or even expected. Which was actually perfect. Incredibly touching, beautifully told!",5,0.9946,Positive,221

Yes, I know; we aren’t meant to judge books by their covers. But we all do, don’t we? I knew I needed to give this book a home, so I tucked it to the side and bought it after my shift.

That book was Firefly Lane by Kristin Hannah. I absolutely devoured it, and it devoured me right back. The writing, the character development, the plot; all of these perfectly done components combined to make me a lifelong fan of this author. I quickly found other books she’d written, and they gripped me in the same way Firefly did.

Kristin Hannah’s novels are the kind that stay with you long after you’ve closed the cover. I can still recall scenes from Firefly Lane, etched in to my mind as though it were a fond memory. This phenomena occurs over and over again as I read her novels; just glimpsing a cover can take me back to a certain scene, where I read it, and who I was when I read it.

The Four Winds is another beautifully crafted novel that will transport its reader across the plains. It follows Elsa, a woman who has always been told her life will be a certain way, as she breaks free of those constraints and strives to be who she believes she can be. The novel follows her path through the Dust Bowl and to California, where the four winds have pulled her to try and make a new life.

This book reaches into your heart and clenches it from the moment you meet Elsa. She is strong, capable, intelligent, and vastly undervalued. Elsa’s story is expansive and encompassing, told as she battles the inner battles forged from years of emotional abuse to the physical battles of surviving the Depression.

Elsa struggles to reconcile the American Dream promised to her with her reality of struggle, and must choose between fighting to survive or fighting to thrive.

Hannah’s writing is impeccable as ever, as she weaves this story through multiple timelines and narrators. The reader is dropped into 1930s Texas on the brink of the Depression and Dust Bowl, written in an enveloping way such that you can nearly feel the heat and taste the dust.

The characters are thoroughly developed and portrayed exquisitely. From the tempestuous teen to the callous parent to the potential amorous suitor, each character has depth and layers. The plot is intricately woven across space and time, guiding the reader through historic events in a delicate balance of providing the historical context without over-explaining.

Once again, Hannah will wrench your heart this way and that, so go into this one with tissues. These characters are ones that will stay with you, jumping back into your memory when you pass a field of wheat gently waving the in the breeze, or see a wide blue sky with just a hint of rain at the horizon.

Beginning in northwestern Texas in 1921 it is the story of a “ugly duckling” sister in a wealthy family. She’s usually relegated to her room to read, but at 25 she seeks to find a life of her own and ends up being forced to marry the father of her unborn child, an Italian immigrant’s son. You might think of this as a modern retelling of The Grapes of Wrath. It’s a powerful story of a transition in American history that was challenging. Readers of Jess Walter’s The Millions, about union organizers in Spokane, Washington in the early part of the twentieth century, will enjoy this book. Hannah, a mega-seller in popular literature, will introduce a new group of readers to early labor struggles although in this book the heroes are wearing white and the bad guys are definitely wearing black. Once us snobby readers give into the romance, we find we really like the story.",4,0.933,Positive,175
329,"Kristin's books always seem a little daunting to me when I pick one up—they are all a bit hefty. But the subject matter she writes about is always so interesting to me and I find myself flying through the pages. The Four Winds was exactly that and so much more. So many pages but oh, it was so, so good!

The Dust Bowl and the Great Depression were devastating times for the United States, especially in the Plains states. The Four Winds personalizes the hardship and struggles of the time, through the lives of Elsa Martinelli and her family. What they, and others like them, had to endure was heartbreaking—everything in their lives was either lost or taken away.

I absolutely loved this story and learned so much about the time period and the unimaginable conditions that everyone had to endure. I know I will be thinking about Elsa and her family for a very long time. This is a story that I highly recommend, especially for lovers of historical fiction or American history.",5,0.9649,Positive,174

Kristin Hannah comes through again, and this time, it's in the Dust Bowl and on the California cotton fields.

This is my third Hannah read, and I have yet to find myself disappointed. The main character of this one, Elsa, is riveting from the start. She has a challenging family life, which is made worse through its visible and lasting impacts on her. The first signs of hope for her appear in her found family and carry on through additional found family members, as well as - especially - her own children. Her development and the growth of the people she encounters are what makes this novel great. I do think the California section of the novel is unnecessarily lengthy in places, but not in a way that degrades the overall quality of the narrative.

This is another solid product from Hannah, which incoming fans - and those new to Hannah's work - will equally enjoy. The author's note is not to be missed, by the way.",5,0.8357,Positive,169

332,"This book is filled with emotions; sadness, anger love and fear. I had to walk away from this story several times, but I always came back. Set in the 1930’s in Texas it gives a look at life in the Great Depression, and the Dust Bowl. When families felt the only way to live was go west, only to find more poverty, starvation and even less chance of survival. All these people wanted to do was work to protect their families. Elsa Martinelli is a symbol of all the amazing work women did in that heartbreaking time. She loved her children more than anything, and after her husband just walks away from them, she knows she has to be strong. When things went wrong, her only thought was to take her children home to Texas and their loving grandparents and the farm they were raised on.

This time the world is quite familiar to anyone who read Dust Bowl fiction and has seen Dorothea Lange's photographs of the era. Added factors are Italian immigrant families in Texas, a protagonist who feels unloved and unattractive, and a complicated dynamic between mother and daughter.

Most interesting to me was the last section about the migrant farm workers (all of whom were called Okies no matter where they hail from) and their struggle to be seen as human, not filth, in towns, schools and door-to-door. The American dream is a nightmare to them, and there was absolutely nowhere to turn. No wonder the ruling class of agricultural barons were so vehemently against the ""Commies"", as fair wages would cut into profits.

336,"The Four Winds follows the story of Elsa Martinelli. Rejected by her family, Elsa becomes pregnant and marries an Italian immigrant named Rafe and moves from her parents' wealthy home to a farm. Over the next few years, she works tirelessly to care for her mother and father-in-law, husband, and two children. However, the Dust Bowl wrecks their fields and their way of life as they struggle to get by with no money and no crops to sell. When her husband abandons them and her son Ant's lungs nearly give out from the dust, Elsa packs up her and her two children and drives to California in search of a better life.

Once in California, Elsa realizes that California isn't the golden land so many have described. Jobs are hard to come by for ""okies"" fleeing the Dust Bowl and Elsa, Loreda, and Ant are forced to live in a tent and live off of meager pay for picking cotton. As their conditions and mistreatment worsens, Loreda is pulled into a group of communists fighting for better treatment and pay for migrant workers as Elsa works to keep her children fed and clothed. As things get worse, however, she realizes that hard work might not be enough.

This book was incredible. I shouldn't be surprised as a long-time fan of Kristin Hannah, but this book once again blew me away, especially the last quarter. Elsa's lifelong search for love in her family, her husband, and her children and her drive to care for them create such a beautiful story of motherhood. I couldn't help but root for Elsa as she fought against horrible odds and circumstances. I'll admit that I didn't care for Loreda as much as she fit the rebellious teenager caricature.

There were times in my journey when it felt as if that penny and the hope it represented were the only things that kept me going. I came west in search of a better life, but my American dream was turned into a nightmare by poverty and hardship and greed. These past few years have been a time of things lost: Jobs. Homes. Food. The land we loved turned on us, broke us all, even the stubborn old men who used to talk about the weather and congratulate each other on the season’s bumper wheat crop.

Premise/plot: The Four Winds is a historical novel set primarily in the 1930s during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. Primarily. Readers spend a brief period of time with Elsa, our heroine, in the 1920s which sets up the story.

Elsa Wolcott--when we first meet her--is twenty-five and feeling every bit a spinster. Her parents have almost molded her into that role of unlovable, unworthy spinster. But after reading Age of Innocence, she decides enough is enough is enough. She buys herself some red silk and makeup, sews herself a dress, and sneaks out of the house looking for something--anything--to make life bearable. What she finds is a younger man, an Italian, who wants to take her for a drive out to a barn for a good time. A good time is just what she's craving--though she might not have been brave enough to be blunt. A few months later, Elsa realizes she's with child--as do her parents--and she's driven to the Martinelli homestead and dumped. Elsa and Rafe marry. This first preliminary section ends with the birth of that child--a baby girl she names Laredo.

The rest of the novel is set during the Dust Bowl and will see our characters--Elsa and family--move from the Texas Panhandle to California.

My thoughts: Beautifully written. That's what I'd say first and foremost. The Four Winds is BITTERSWEET. If it didn't have that epilogue, I would say it was more BITTER than sweet, I tell you. But even when things are at their bleakity-bleak-bleakest the narrative is so compelling that the story is just beautiful and the characters fully developed. There were so many complex relationships in this one!!! In particular, the relationship between mothers and daughters and parent and child. (I love, love, love, love, love the relationship between Elsa and her mother-in-law, Rose.)

There were times when I wanted to interfere, to yell a bit. But I take that as a good sign. And it's not like I have alternative better answers that would with certainty have 'saved the day.' (I don't. Not really. Not with certainty.) But there were plenty of times I was like THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? For example, I don't see why California was seen as the one and only answer by desperate people. There are other states too. But I digress.

I think it balanced bleakity-bleak with hope quite well. But I do have to say that though the ending was completely authentically in tune with the whole novel--everything was leading up to this--it was still WRONG on a purely emotional level.

Is it clean? Would I recommend it to those looking for clean reads? Mostly. The first bit is on-screen but non-descriptive. It also doesn't take up much space. The last bit is a bit more descriptive--but again not page-consuming. I would say the purpose is realism and life-as-it-is and not in any way romance. (More time is spent describing picking cotton.) The language--I think there are a few words here and there. But again it felt natural enough and not for shock value or being there for the sake of being there.

Quotes:

Elsa Wolcott had spent years in enforced solitude, reading fictional adventures and imagining other lives. In her lonely bedroom, surrounded by the novels that had become her friends, she sometimes dared to dream of an adventure of her own, but not often.

Hope began to dim for a woman when she turned twenty. By twenty-two, the whispers in town and at church would have begun, the long, sad looks. By twenty-five, the die was cast. An unmarried woman was a spinster.

There had to be opportunities out there, but where would she find them? The library. Books held the answer to every question.

Books had always been her solace; novels gave her the space to be bold, brave, beautiful, if only in her own imagination.

You are a town girl,” Mr. Martinelli said in a thick Italian accent. “Not anymore, I guess.” “This is a good answer.” He bent down, scooped up a handful of dirt. “My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family. We plant, we tend, we harvest. I make wine from grapes that I brought here from Sicily, and the wine I make reminds me of my father. It binds us, one to another, as it has for generations. Now it will bind you to us.” “I’ve never tended to anything.” He looked at her. “Do you want to change that?” Elsa saw compassion in his dark eyes, as if he knew how afraid she’d been in her life, but she had to be imagining it. All he knew about her was that she was here now and she’d brought his son down with her. “Beginnings are only that, Elsa. When Rosalba and I came here from Sicily, we had seventeen dollars and a dream. That was our beginning. But it wasn’t what gave us this good life. We have this land because we worked for it, because no matter how hard life was, we stayed here. This land provided for us. It will provide for you, too, if you let it.”

“Believe me, Elsa, this little girl will love you as no one ever has … and make you crazy and try your soul. Often all at the same time.”

“That she would love me as no one else ever would and break my heart?” “Sì. And you see how right I was?” “About part of it, I guess. She certainly breaks my heart.” “Yes. I was a trial to my poor mamma, too. The love, it comes in the beginning of her life and at the end of yours. God is cruel that way. Your heart, is it too broken to love?” “Of course not.” “So, you go on.” She shrugged, as if to say, Motherhood. “What choice is there for us?” “It just … hurts.” Rose was silent for a while; finally, she said, “Yes.”

Dust pneumonia. That was what they called it, but it was really loss and poverty and man’s mistakes.

“You are the daughter I always wanted,” Rose said. “Ti amo.” “And you are my mother,” Elsa said. “You saved me, you know.” “Mothers and daughters. We save each other, sì?”

The four winds have blown us here, people from all across the country, to the very edge of this great land, and now, at last, we make our stand, fight for what we know to be right. We fight for our American dream, that it will be possible again. Jack says that I am a warrior and, while I don’t believe it, I know this: A warrior believes in an end she can’t see and fights for it. A warrior never gives up. A warrior fights for those weaker than herself. It sounds like motherhood to me.",5,0.9988,Positive,1269
338,"I have read five of Ms. Hannah’s novels. I would give the read itself a 3* but the beautiful writing and the incredible research that went into this book definitely earns it a 4* rating.

This book was an incredibly depressing read. I felt so much for the characters that I really had to hold myself back from crying. Particularly when injustice after injustice was endured and things kept going from bad to worse. It made me wonder how much can a person really stand before their spirit is completely broken.

Elsa was born into a family of “means”, however she suffered from a complete lack of love, attention or any kind of affection. Elsa had two sisters who were considered pretty and married at a young age. Elsa’s mother had told her this when she was in her twenties, ”You are unmarriageable, Elsinore, even with all our money and standing. No man of note wants an unattractive wife who looms over him” This last a comment on the fact that she was tall for women then, about six feet tall.

On her 25th birthday she decides to go into town and celebrate. She meets Rafe who finds Elsa interesting and beautiful in her own way. When she tells her parents that she is in love, her parents want to know who the man is. Her father then forces the marraige between Rafe and Elsa.

There are a few good years when Elsa and Rafe are living with the Martinelli’s who have embraced Elsa and their baby daughter Loreda. They are very warm and caring people and Elsa at last feels a part of a family.

Then The Great Depression and the worst drought in the history of the Great Plains hits and it’s a double whammy for the US farmers and workers.

After years of near starvation on the family farm Elsa takes her daughter Loreda and young son Ant west to California. It is said that there is work there and money to be made. However as history has told us, both farmers from the drought stricken “Dust Bowl” and workers from the cities all converge on California looking for jobs. I had hoped that here at last would be a new beginning for Elsa and her children.

It would spoil the story to tell much else about the plot. In comparing Ms. Hannah’s novels, I felt that there was hope and more vibrancy in The Nightingale and The Great Alone. This book felt like just one nightmare to the next. I realize that this is the true history of what the people endured, but it is very hard to read. I kept looking for a silver lining which never seemed to come. Perhaps in her Elsa’s daughter’s generation.

The characters were incredibly well developed and I felt for all of them. The dust storms were so well described I could envision how horrible a twister of dust blowing at 50 mph would be. So forceful that it got between every small crack in the house. In the beginning the beautiful wheat fields were described; how tall, golden and strong the wheat stalks were and went on for acres and acres. She again described some terrible scenes in California when the rains caused flooding in the tent and truck camps set up along the ditches close to the farms. How horrible to have everything you own covered in mud for weeks on end.

As you can see this book did touch me in many ways. I went online to find out more about the drought and “Dust Bowl” and realized how little I had known. This book opened my eyes to the farmers tragedy. I had read much about The Great Depression but not much about the farmer’s plight.

This is a very eye opening novel. I loved the author’s notes in which she addressed the pandemic that we are now going through and hoped that the book would teach us this:
“We’ve gone through bad times before and survived, even thrived. History has shown us the strength and durability of the human spirit. In the end, it is our idealism and our courage and our commitment to one another--what we have in common--that will save us. Now in these dark days, we can look to history, to the legacy of the greatest generation and the story of our own past, and take strength from it.” I hope that we can learn this lesson and pass it on to our children.

Kristin Hannah
Julia Whelan

Kristin Hannah has written some unforgettable novels every one featuring a strong determined woman, but this time she’s outdone herself with The Four Winds, a visceral, disturbing, eloquent yet timely historical masterpiece. While reading/listening to this novel the audience will be transported to the great plains and then to California during the depression and subsequent dust bowl where Kristin’s beautiful, painful majestic narrative will pull images straight from Ken Burns documentary, The Dust Bowl and implant these disconcerting pictures into the heads of her readers. The characters, every one is unforgettable, from Elsa’s overbearing parents, to her weak husband Raphe to her incredible in-laws, Rose and Tony. Then there are Elsa and her children who star in the entire novel, Anthony (Ant) is adorable and has to grow up in such a hurry and is a testament to the durability of children. Loreda is an enigma, a normal teenaged girl with all the smart mouthed attitude and yet she’s also robbed of her young womanhood and thrown into the chaos that is being a US immigrant in California during the dust bowl and yet she’s exceptionally inspiring. And then there’s Elsa, what an incredible, remarkable, unsinkable woman, a woman who in spite of being told at a young age she’d never amount to anything takes her children on a thousand mile journey all by themselves and survives. There are also some really fantastic supporting characters like Elsa’s friend Jean from the ditch camp and of course near the end Jack but it’s Elsa by far that is the real stand out with Loreda a second in this novel. For any fan of historical literary fiction, strong women protagonists, women’s fiction and of course fans of this incredible master storyteller will find it impossible to put this fast paced, headed straight to the top of the best-seller list, two tissue box, novel down.

Julia Whelan is herself a master storyteller because it’s absolute magic how she brings this novel to life for listeners. Her emotional rendering will bring tears and laughter and she portrays every character perfectly, men women and children. In fact her Anthony (Ant) is absolutely precious.

340,"Not since The Grapes of Wrath have I been so realistically immersed in such a time of hardships as the Great Depression and droughts of the Dust Bowl areas of the 1930’s. Told from a woman’s point of view, I found Elsa Wolcott’s story inspirational.
The trials of an undervalued, unloved girl, who painfully finds life and purpose is only the beginning.
The introduction focuses on the loneliness of Elsa within her family, the role they’ve colluded to keep her in, unwittingly or not, leaving Elsa stunted by their unyielding perception of her.
Her one moment of fight for freedom, the making of a dress in rose silk, leads to something else. A small but devastatingly painful vignette. I must admit when I saw the silk dress reemerge in a different guise I was shocked. Nothing said stay in your alloted place as did that symbolic moment. Elsa was not allowed to be more. When she was shown attention, of course she gravitated towards it. She was thirsty. This in turn leads to being cast out from her family into a new one.
Set in Texas, Elsa now a Martinelli cleaves to her new family. Their joys are hers and when the continuous drought tuns the Texas panhandle into a dust bowl, she fights on.
Elsa’s story gives insights into the spirit of many of the women of the time despite the meanness of comfortable fearful and their lip service to Christian charity. Others are supportive, and nowhere more so than the women in the shanty camps of California
The dust bowl descriptions of the destructive dirt winds are harrowing. A manmade climate crisis that continues to haunt the past and mirror the future. Turning cows milk brown is just one. The threat of dust pneumonia another. Birds falling from the sky, animals and people painfully depleted.
When Elsa and her children leave for the promise of a golden Californian future, the bad had turned to worse.
Fear and greed is the Californian face. Elsa and her family make friends, meet with ridicule and hatred and become employment fodder for merciless cotton kings. Chewed up and spat out.
The influx of peoples referred to as the Okies was mammoth. Desperation and competition vied as government assistance was withdrawn. Any jobs the people did get were poorly paid and then wages were slashed for profit. The shameful practice of having pickers being economically beholden to the company, where the company charges rent and pays in chits that can only be redeemed in the company store, was rife. Families could never get out from under their debt. Children joined the picker lines. This was enforced labor. The Okies were economical slave labor. The choices were live or die.
Elsa is a warrior. Her trials in Texas were almost unbearable, and yet the California experience trumps even that. She is a woman with a fierce heart when it counts. Her meeting with a communist labor agitator is another turning point.
I was glued to every word. I was equally elated, appalled and devastated,
Hannah is a strong voice speaking into the past and the present. Four Winds has all the earmarks of a classic bringing alive those times for today’s readers, jogging us into reflection and introspection. One can’t help but see parallels between the then and now.
Her author’s note is a fitting finale.

341,"The Four Winds – Kristin Hannah

The year is 1921, and Elsa Wolcott is set to celebrate her 25th birthday. Considered sickly after surviving a childhood illness, she has been neglected by her family as her siblings thrive. Out wandering around town she sees a bolt of beautiful red fabric in a shoppe – impulsively she purchases the material, and creates herself a beautiful dress. Further defying her parents, she dons the dress and heads out for a night of fun – not knowing that decisions she makes this night will change her future forever.

Flash forward to 1934, where Elsa lives with her husband Rafe, his parents and two children on a farm. Residing in the panhandle of Texas, they are barely surviving the Great Depression and a drought that has lasted a couple of years, creating what is known in present day as the Dust Bowl period. As she sees her small town dying before her eyes with crops that can’t grow, and families and farm animals that go hungry, she works twice as hard to keep her small family safe. Her husband, haunted by what his life has become, leaves abruptly one night, taking a train out of town As conditions worsen, and the dust storms wreak havoc, more and more families abandon farms in hopes of work and relief in California, and soon Elsa and her children decide to make the journey as well.

Leaving Rafe’s parents to tend the farm, Elsa takes the family truck, her children, and belongings as they make their way out to California. Arriving to beautiful scenery and the hopes of jobs and financial security, they soon learn that their type – ‘Okies’ - aren’t welcome, and soon Elsa finds herself in the fields picking cotton, and increasingly in debt as she tries to make ends meet. There is unrest in the land as people workers rebel, pitting landowners against their employees, and the words of ‘union’ and ‘strike’ are soon whispered, creating anger and tension amongst the region, with Elsa finding herself in a very difficult position…

As is anything written by Kristin Hannah, the story is beautifully written, yet contained a history lesson and a brief, yet painful glimpse into the lives of Americans in the 1930’s. As Elsa and her family endured, and endured again, I kept waiting for the happy ending – I cannot imagine surviving the things that they did, possessing the sheer force of will that made Elsa’s spirit so indomitable – a trait her children carried as well. But, given the nature of the story and the time period, it was an emotionally draining read when we, as a world, are also faced with such uncertainty in our present, as well.

342,"A powerful story about loss, survival and bravery during the Great Depression.

I'll be upfront, historical fiction is not a genre I read very often. But I make an exception when Kristin Hannah is the author. Why? She is one of the best authors, in my opinion, to capture the strength of women under some of the harshest of conditions.

Elsa Wolcott/Martinelli, the heroine of this book, is no exception. However, if you asked Elsa's family, or Elsa herself, she would be described as weak. After suffering from rheumatic fever as a young teen, her body projected that weakness. But page by page, Elsa showed that she has a fighting spirit. Some internal mechanism within her that pushed her to dust herself off and get back up after each time she is knocked down.

""I want . . . to be brave,"" she said, almost too softly to be heard.
""What scares you?""
""Everything.""

While I hated life for Elsa under the Wolcotts, the family that should have loved her at all costs, I loved that she got a second chance with the Martinelli family. Her union was far from welcomed, but with time, Rose and Tony, began to accept her as one of their own. And I think that unexpected love repaired some of the damage that her own family caused over the years.

""You have the heart of a lion. Don't believe anyone who tells you different.""

This isn't the first book that I've read about the Great Depression, but it is one of the first that explored what drove a family to take the treacherous journey West in search of a better life. A good portion of the story centers on life in the Texas Panhandle during the Dust Bowl. I had no idea how persistent and horrific life under these conditions could be. It amazed me that each day, this family got up and tried to provide for one another instead of giving up. And the strength they showed during this time would become invaluable when they have no choice but to pack up and go West.

There is so much tragedy and heartbreak in this story, that I cherished every positive moment for Elsa, no matter how small.
New friends.
Repairing a damaged relationship with her daughter.
Four walls and a bed.
Small compliments from a man.
Elsa deserved each and every one of those moments.

While the Great Depression exposed the vulnerabilities of those in need, it also brought to light the strength of character and resilience of the American worker. Although Else always wished for bravery, she proves on more than one occasion that this is a characteristic that hasn't alluded to her. And it's a critical moment, she lets that bravery shine for everyone to witness. *sobs*

344,"I received a free electronic ARC of this exceptional historical novel from Kristin Hannah, Netgalley, and a personal invite from St. Martin's Press, the publisher. I have read this novel of my own volition, and this review reflects my honest opinion of this work. Thank you all for sharing your hard work with me. As usual, Kristin Hannah takes us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions as we accompany this true grit Italian family in the 1930s through the years of drought, the plains states dustbowl, and the depression, as Elsa Wilcott of the Texas panhandle town of Dalhart chooses to make drastic changes to her future plans.

A survivor of childhood rheumatic fever, Elsa was shuffled off to the side, treated as an invalid with no saving graces by her busy family. Though the eldest of three daughters, the family chose to isolate her in her room, where she read everything she could get her hands on. It was considered by her mother that she was too ugly to even consider marriage and children, not long for this world with her rheumatoid-induced heart problems, thus not worth educating, and allowed only Sunday worship service and her walks to the city library as a way to socialize. Most painfully, her entire family refused to include her in their lives at home as well as out in the community. The wealthiest family in Dalhart, there is no excuse for limiting her socialization and education, but she is powerless in their arguments and heartbroken by their excuses. Her only friend was her now deceased Grandfather, who gave her the advice she is going to base the rest of her life on. He said, ""Don't worry about dying, Elsa. Worry about not living. Be brave."" At 25, she decides to take her future into her own hands. Completely naive with little interaction with people and normal activities, she begins to make her own choices even if she has to rely on the information attained from novels.

And it was a mess, for a time, her life. She was banned from returning to her own home after one of her decisions backfires, but it may be for the best. The farming Martinelli family, though reluctant to fold her into their world, are even at first glance warmer and kinder than her own. And the lifestyle - the chores and patterns of life on the farm are wonderfully exciting to this city girl. It is with a full heart that she adapts to life on a working farm.

And then the drought begins. The Great Plains loses all of its topsoil - millions of tons of it - to the severe winds as year after year the rains don't come. Change is coming. Can Elsa Wilcott Martinelli adapt fast enough to survive this, too? Can she be that brave?",5,0.9424,Positive,474
345,"In the 1920's the small farming community of Lonesome Tree in the Texas Panhandle was beautiful and prosperous, and for newly married Elsa Martinelli, her salvation from a lonely and reclusive upbringing. She quickly grew to love and respect the land, and settled into a hard but rewarding existence. That all changed with the stock market crash of ’29 and the start of the Great Depression. Then came the years of drought followed by the dust bowl – a series of storms with high winds and choking dust responsible for killing every crop planted and filling Elsa's home and beloved land with sand, dirt, and destruction.

With no end in sight to the dust, drought, and despair, unable to make ends meet, and with their health in jeopardy, Elsa and her family are forced to abandon their home and flee west to California in the hope of finding work and a better life. What they find instead is discrimination, injustice, poverty, and danger at every turn.

I now consider The Four Winds one of my favourite books ever, focusing on a very dark chapter in America's history. And I almost didn't read it, was put off because I'd heard there were scenes involving scared, starving, dying animals, which is a real trigger for me. And I'm not going to lie, those parts were difficult to stomach, but they weren't as bad or as graphic as I had feared, and they were thankfully brief and minimal. The depths of human pain, suffering and cruelty the characters endured affected me more, and saw me crying the hardest. But equally Elsa and her family's compassion, resilience, perseverance and determination, was an inspiration and the love and hope they maintained even in the saddest and most desperate of circumstances was incredible.

Kristin Hannah's extensive and richly detailed research combined with a realistic representation of the historical era was equally captivating and harrowing. I swear I could taste the dust. She blended fact and fiction seamlessly together in a dramatic, informative, engrossing, fast-paced manner. I'm embarrassed to admit that everything I previously knew about dust bowls I learnt from watching the sci-fi movie Interstellar and I honestly thought the storms depicted were largely a dystopian invention rather than a real life ecological and natural disaster. The characters were wonderfully drawn and memorable and the mother/daughter relationship between Elsa and Loreda (our two narrators) was my favourite. I loved that despite everything that was happening, Loreda was still portrayed as a typical teenager with all the growing pains and resentment and anger towards her mother you would expect from a girl her age.

Suffice to say I will be recommending The Four Winds far and wide to everyone I encounter.",5,-0.9919,Negative,454
346,"I have to admit this is my very first Kristin Hannah book. I am truly ashamed to admit that but it will not be my last. There are so many and each sounds so good. I even own a couple. How's that for crazy.

This book is so good. It made me laugh, cry, get angry, yell and cry some more. It will give you so many emotions. That is what makes a book great in my opinion.

Elsa had a hard life. From the time she was fourteen years old she was told she had a weak heart and was kept from doing anything that she truly wanted to do. Not because her parents really loved her enough to protect her but because they were somewhat ashamed of her. She was not like her two sisters. She was not like all the other girls. She was so much more though. You will get to know the true Elsa and how incredibly strong she really is. You will love her too. Or at least I did. I think she is probably one of the strongest females in any book I have ever read. She's a daughter, mother, wife, friend. She's a hard working woman who has given so much to others. Her life is hard but she is not one to give up. She fights for her children. She works so hard for them. She's all they have and they are all she has.

This book is based on an awful time in America's history. When crops died and there was no rain. No rain. Can you imagine that? Absolutely no rain for so long. Things go from bad to worse when the dust storms hit too. This is a deep historical fiction book based on real life in the early to mid thirties. What families went through. What they did to just survive. How cruel some people could be. It's a book that will keep you turning pages until the very end. Then you have to read the Author's Notes.. I'm so very sorry for the loss of you and your husband's friend Ms Hannah. I've lost a few too and it hurts.

This book makes you feel the desperation that the people in this era went through. The hopelessness they felt. The need they felt. You will feel Elsa's pain in different places. When she is alone and thinks it's all her fault. When she feels love and finally knows she is worthy. When she feels so much pride for her children. When her daughter finally looks at her as if she is a human being. You know teenagers. They are always the same....

This is a great book. A very deeply touching book. One that will stick with you. It's just a great all around story of hope, loss, love and forgiveness. Of seeing your hard work pay off.

Thank you #NetGalley, #KristinHannah, #StMartin'sPress for this ARC. This is my own true feelings about this book.

5/5 stars and the highest recommendation to you all. Grab this book as soon as possible and read it.",5,0.9591,Positive,518
347,"I went into this, my first Kristin Hannah book, expecting emotion.

I was not let down. This book is powerful. It's oddly timely. Who would have thought that so many things about The Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, and inequality would ring true almost 100 years later? Ms. Hannah even reflects on the covid-19 pandemic world she's releasing this book into in her note at the end of the novel.

It's interesting how we can learn so much from historical fiction. I feel like I learn more from heartfelt historical fiction novels than I did out of a history textbook in school. Hannah brings to life her characters. The main characters are Elsa and her daughter, Loreda. Elsa grows up in a cold family. They have love, but none for her. All she seeks is acceptance and love and soon finds that in the arms of Rafe Martinelli. When her mother realizes that Elsa is showing signs of pregnancy, Elsa is to pack a bag and then essentially dumped at the Martinelli farm and succinctly cut off.

While her welcome isn't quite warm, it's still better than the distance and hostility of her own family. But it isn't until the day her daughter, Loreda, is born that Elsa's heart knows the full capacity of love. Even as Loreda grows up and pulls away from her mother, Elsa's true happiness comes from the success and happiness of Loreda and her son, Ant. Misfortune after misfortune pile up and soon Elsa, Loreda, and Ant are packed up and headed out for California in search of the promised jobs.

This book just lays bare the reality of the Great Depression. How hardships kept coming and laid family's flat. The goal was to survive and there was barely any chance for survival, let alone getting ahead or overcoming and thriving.

Both Loreda and Elsa are a pleasure to witness throughout this story. The growth and development of these characters by both age and harsh reality is an honor to witness. This is not a light-hearted, fun read. But it's a story that I know will stick with me. I'm too far removed from the Great Depression and the people in my family who may have been able to share their story with me have passed away. While the Martinelli family is fictional, they tell the story of so many Americans.

I'll recommend this book left and right and encourage people to hear the stories of the Great Depression and pray our nation never experiences that level of disaster again. A poignant reminder for love and generosity during this global pandemic.",5,0.9975,Positive,436
348,"In light of the pandemic and the election, this timely book calls back to another time when the world upended and seemed hopeless for so many Americans. However, this is a sobering novel that shows us why the Great Depression and Dust Bowl were actually much more traumatic than what is going on today.

You first meet Elsa, a wealthy girl in Texas who is sort of a sad sack. Her family treats her like she is secondary to her sisters and also like she’s a fragile piece of china due to her illness (I believe she had rheumatic fever in her teens). She loves to read and wants to be brave like her grandfather, but she is thwarted by her family who wants to sentence her to a lonely, dull life. She meets a man who brings her out of that state and who changes her entire life.

Years later, Elsa resides on her in-laws’ farm in Texas where she becomes a welcome part of the family and feels loved for the most part. The Dust Bowl takes place, forcing Elsa to make a decision about either staying or leaving for California. Her decision will ultimately change her.

So much research must have gone in to the writing of this book, and I applaud Kristin Hannah for it. She doesn’t really sugarcoat any parts of the story but shows the resilience of a woman learning about how strong she can be. Although I mentioned that she is a sad sack, truly she is not at all–she’s shoved into that category without being allowed to grow. What happens to her throughout the novel demonstrates that she can and will grow even blossom into a stronger woman.

Despite the dour subject matter, the writing is not dull, and the descriptions clearly depict the places where Elsa ends up. The story takes some turns that were surprising, some in the end that I found were way too implausible and one plotline in the book I felt was wrapped up too easily and comfortably to the point of being utterly unrealistic.

In the past, I really never took to Hannah’s writing except I did read and enjoy The Great Alone for my book club. This and the book about Alaska that I previously mentioned have inspired me to read some more of her works. If you’re looking for a light story to cheer you up, this is not the one, but it presents a powerful story of the will to survive even during the darkest days.

Thank you NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for an advanced reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review! It was a pleasure!",4,0.9972,Positive,448
349,"It is 1930s Texas and the depression, drought and the Dust Bowl has led to desperation. Elsa Martinelli has to make a very difficult decision to move with her two children to California, with hopes of a much better life. Instead they are met with prejudice and issues like inflation. However, Elsa is indomitable, and her courage and strong will shines through time and again.

Elsa never had an easy life. As a teenager she nearly succumbed to serious illness, and this had a long-term effect on her life. Also, she never quite measured up to her sisters and never felt the strong arms of love from her parents. As Elsa became pregnant, she was forced to marry. Blessedly, her in-laws, Rose and Tony, welcomed her with open arms. However, as the years progressed, now the mother of two children, extreme conditions made life impossible in Texas. And, like many families, Elsa wanted something better for her children.

Elsa made the perfect protagonist. A strong woman who rose time and again, despite the incredible odds against her. Elsa felt so very real to me. I connected with her from the very beginning, whether as a woman living vicariously through the books she reads, as a daughter who couldn't measure up, as a wife who felt completely alone and as a mother who would move mountains for her children.

I only discovered Kristin Hannah this year, and have been chipping away at her backlist. Actually, I had planned to read The Great Alone last month, but time got away from me. At this point I have read The Nightingale, Summer Island, Winter Garden, Fly Away, Firefly Lane and True Colors. So, I have a lot more to read and greatly look forward to the opportunity. Kristin Hannah mixes amazing talent with extensive research, thus always producing incredible stories that manage to compel me from the very first page to the very last word.

This touching story broke me. To be frank, I bawled. Kristin Hannah never ceases to surprise me with the quality she puts into her writing. That time in history was incredibly tragic for many people, and this book did an excellent job at reflecting that time in America. This is in stark contrast to the life we live today with the pandemic. Uncertain times then. Uncertain times now.

350,"Looking for a book to swallow you whole into a different reality? To entertain you while making you think? This is it. I was engrossed from start to finish.
It started in rural Texas during the Dust Bowl, when this formerly productive agricultural area experienced severe drought and dust storms due to unwise land management that caused crops to fail for years. Farmers became so desperate to survive that they left everything behind and fled west by the thousands. This story is about one such woman, Elsa Martinelli, who, after years of trying to survive on their family farm, finally took her two children and drove to California to look for work.
Competing with thousands of other immigrants for the relatively few jobs, while being taken advantage of by greedy landowners in league with government officials and police, their struggle to survive intensified.
As the Depression ground on, fear and poverty fostered hatred and mistrust towards outsiders. First, the Mexican immigrants who farmers had counted on to work the vast fields of the San Joaquin valley for years were denigrated and accused of all sorts of crimes, before being sent back across the border. Then the hordes of Dust Bowl refugees came and took their place. They too were looked down on, treated with cruelty, and forced to live like animals. As increasing numbers arrived, farmers gained power and cheated them mercilessly.
Eventually, conditions there became unbearable and Elsa and her family joined union organizers who were trying to get the farm workers to stand up for their rights. As a war between workers and landowners began to break out, all the Dust Bowl refugees were greatly affected by the violence that followed.
This unflinching look at what fearful and desperate people are capable of in a crisis was timely, especially during this year of the Covid pandemic. Fearful people are easily duped into believing that it’s outsiders who are the source of their problems, not the rich and powerful who are happy to take advantage of their desperation and distraction to gather even more wealth and power. The author has illuminated our current situation by allowing us to experience vicariously another time of great difficulty and suffering. This book entertained me thoroughly while making me think. A great combination.",5,-0.9924,Negative,380
351,"From the number-one bestselling author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone comes a powerful American epic about love and heroism and hope, set during the Great Depression, a time when the country was in crisis and at war with itself, when millions were out of work and even the land seemed to have turned against them.

“My land tells its story if you listen. The story of our family.”

Texas, 1921. A time of abundance. The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era. But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak. Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life. With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.

By 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open. Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains. Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.

In this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.

My Thoughts: A beautiful family story about love, loss, and bravery, The Four Winds tugged at my heartstrings as it led us through numerous challenges while introducing us to memorable characters. Elsa fought hard to teach her children about standing up for what they need and for what is right.

The author paints a vivid picture of the family battling the Great Depression while living in the Texas Dust Bowl, and then takes us along to another battle for survival in the California migrant experience. A triumphant yet emotional end kept me turning pages, while rooting for them all. 4.5 stars.",4,-0.2617,Negative,372
352,"First of all, The Four Winds was well worth the wait. Yes, it was bleak and depressing at times, but this type of book is what we need to read, especially in times such as we are living now. This story of Elsa Martinelli and her family living in the Oklahoma panhandle is just one example of what thousands of families endured during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression of the 1930’s.

I rate books not only for how well written they are, but also for how they make me feel. Four Winds definitely made me feel many things; sadness, despair, hope, respect, and anger. I bawled my eyes out several times. What makes a book like this an excellent read is that is makes the reader not only feel, but also think. I couldn’t help but remember all the stories my grandparents told me about living through the Great Depression and the hard times they endured. I thought about all the people who are suffering today during the pandemic from loss of jobs and income and are struggling to get by. I fear that if we suffered something today as truly devastating as the Dust Bowl, we could not survive. Could we save every scrap of food and make a meal out of it? Most Americans get by on ready-made meals or meal delivery. Could we make clothes out of leftover fabrics and scraps? Many today possess no sewing skills. Could we live off the land? Our grandparents had survival skills that have long been forgotten. Yes, they suffered, but they had the grit and fortitude, and the skills to survive.

I was especially ignorant of all that the people of the Dust Bowl suffered. I didn’t realize how badly they were treated by both the government and their fellow Americans when they left their homes for a better life. It was truly heartbreaking to read. Such a dark time in our history, but the human spirit always fights to survive.

I listened to this via Audible and the narrator was Julia Whelan, one of my favorite narrators, did an excellent job bringing the story to life. This is a book I will not soon forget. In fact, I also purchased an autographed hardcover for my library. I gave this poignant masterpiece five stars.",5,0.1654,Positive,385

A drought has devastated the Great Plains in 1931. The Martinellis farm is struggling along with all the farms in the area. There are dust storms all the time and no projection for when things will be better. Many of the Martinelli’s neighbors are moving west where they are told jobs are plentiful. Elsa has to decide if she will stay and struggle with the land she loves or move to California to the unknown with the hope of a better life. What will Elsa choose? How will Elsa’s choices affect her family?

I loved The Four Winds. The Four Winds is an excellent story and told well. I am a big fan of Kristin Hannah and The Four Winds lived up to my high expectations. Elsa is a wonderful character. She would do anything for her family even when they don’t appreciate it. Elsa grew up with a family that didn’t love her. Then she married into a family that didn’t want her that became the family she always wanted. The relationship Elsa has with her in-laws is what she always wished she had with her parents. Elsa is not happy in her marriage and doesn’t know how to fix it. She loves Rafe so much but he has never felt the same way about her. Elsa struggles so much through the book but doesn’t let anything keep her from fighting for a better life for her family. Loreda, Elsa’s teenage daughter, is very difficult and constantly frustrated with her mother. Elsa’s son, Ant, has health problems that make Elsa’s decision to stay or leave more difficult. Elsa has never really had friends but makes a true friend in an unexpected place. I highly recommend The Four Winds.

354,"Kristin Hannah’s new novels are eagerly awaited by her readers. With today’s publication of The Four Winds, I am sure that many will be purchasing her latest title.

Ms. Hannah has written books about WWII (Winter Garden and The Nightingale) and has established a solid reputation as an author of historical fiction. This time she turns her keen eye to the U.S. in the early to mid 20th century, a time of much pain in the country. The characters in this novel are horribly and deeply affected by what came to be known as the Dust Bowl, and by the Great Depression.

The book opens with a beautifully rendered scene of a small and prosperous Texas town. This depiction immediately draws readers into the world of the story. There are social classes within the town but life is good for its citizens. Of course, this changes as the 1920s turn to the 1930s.

The primary character in the novel is named Elsinore (I’m sure not by accident). She is also known as Els or Elsa. Elsa grew up as the ugly duckling in a family of swans. Sickly, lacking in self-esteem and dominated by her family, she finds escape in the world of books…and one night in the arms of Rafe, part of an Italian family that has a farm outside of town. Their meetings lead to their eventual marriage, one which seems to disappoint them both.

Elsa becomes quite close to Rafe’s parents, has two children and lives an orderly life. All of this changes when the droughts come. The depictions of what this calamity did to both the land and its people makes readers aware of the incredible tragedy and hardship that families faced. What happens to these characters and the impact of their decisions forms the basis of the novel.

Hannah’s readers will most likely think of their own difficulties during Covid as they read this title. This makes the timing of the book feel quite prescient.

Overall, I recommend this novel highly. I did at times feel frustrated, early in the book, by Elsa’s passivity and lack of confidence but the reader must remember that these traits go with how she was raised. Bear with her. Hannah’s fans and new readers will be glad that they do.

355,"Thanks to the publisher & Netgalley for the complimentary ARC. All opinions provided are my own.

The Four Winds begins in 1921 when 25 year old spinster Elsa Wolcott, who’s denied love & acceptance by her upperclass family & feeling stifled in their home & her life, sleeps with Rafe Martinelli, an 18 year old Italian-American man.

Pregnant & summarily denounced by her family, Elsa is sent to marry & live with Rafe & his parents. Reflecting on the fact that she is not loved, still, Elsa resolves to give her baby the family & home she never had.

The book picks back up in 1934 where we learn the effects on Elsa of living in that kind of marriage & trying to keep a home & farm going. Then the dust storms & Great Depression get worse & that’s where the story really takes off.

The Four Winds makes it clear from the Prologue that it’s a story about women, & that’s what we get as Elsa tries to protect her family in TX & across the country in CA. Elsa’s story also becomes a migrant camp worker’s story. The parallels between then & now—when the rich get richer off the work & hardships of those who do the work, when politicians & police work to support the system that keeps rich white people rich—are strong.

Kristin Hannah is a masterful writer & my emotions were definitely engaged—but while Elsa & her arc are inspiring, her story also feels overtly representative in some ways, symbolic. I felt some distance from her. That feeling is underscored for me by the ending, which is well-written but which I didn’t like on a couple of different levels.

This isn’t my favorite of Hannah’s books, & I do have some quibbles, but it’s another stunning offering. I’m grateful that we have this exploration of the power & strength of women & mother-daughter relationships during one of the US’s most tumultuous moments. A story that gives hope & assurance of some kind in the good people are capable of even as it points out some of the worst acts of humanity.

(Published by St. Martin's Press on February 9, 2021)

4.5 Stars.

As ""The Nightingale"" meets ""The Grapes of Wrath"", can we ever expect anything less than epic from the Kristin Hannah brand?

The author revisits two important coincidental periods in American history: the Great Depression (1929-1933), and the Dust Bowl, a period in the 1930's of severe dust storms which devastated the ecology and agriculture of American prairies, mainly, it is said, due to improper topsoil farming.

-----

1921, Texas. Unfortunate circumstances cause the despised, uncomely daughter of a wealthy Dallas merchant to be banished to a farm in the prairies, where enceinte Elsa Wolcott is wedded to her reluctant beau, and where she sheds her sheltered life and discovers her true worth as a person and a woman.

The prairie is also the place where Elsa unexpectedly finds unconditional love from her in-laws, hardy Italian immigrant farmers, Tony and Rosalba Martinelli, their love for her and for her children, Loreda and Ant, the kind of love which she would never ever get from her own uppity family.

1935, San Joaquin Valley, CA. Driven by hardships inflicted by dust storms on the Martinellis' farm, Elsa and the children escape to the Golden State, only to be despised, detested and exploited as migrant ""Okies"". To survive they get deeply involved with the nascent pro-labor movement in California's farmlands. And by necessity, the young ones quickly come of age...

Hoo boy.

This is a really tough book for me to rate.

On the one hand – it was super compelling. Kristin Hannah is an incredibly gifted storyteller. I went into this very hesitantly, having read reviews that indicated it might be a bit more heavy than what my current mental state could handle. But then I started reading it anyway and was immediately sucked in. It was nearly impossible to put down. It was fascinating and horrifying and heartbreaking and – honestly – a true testament to the unbreakability of the human spirit.

Elsa was a lioness. A true warrior. A heroine unlike any I’ve read – maybe ever. She was inspiring and brutally beautiful to read about. I adored her and the way she loved so furiously and generously. I ached for her. My heart bears wounds – those that I felt as a mom whose soul ached at having to witness what Elsa’s sweet family had to endure, and those that I felt as a reader completely caught up in the story – for better and for worse. Elsa was just an amazing literary figure and I feel bound to her somehow.

On the other hand, I turned the last page feeling bereft. While the ending is decidedly hopeful and inspiring in and of itself, it came at too much of a cost for me. The high didn’t reach high enough to overcome the sadness of it all. It was gritty and tough – which is probably a true testament to the time in which the story is set, but as a reader looking for an escape – this was all just a bit too real for me. Too much darkness. Not enough light.

And yet, I will tell you that it was still worth the read. It was interesting and educational. There were moments of profound beauty and moments where I found myself awestruck at all the human heart can bear and still continue beating. It’s not a happy journey, but it was a worthwhile one nonetheless.",4,0.996,Positive,343
358,"I laughed, cried, was ashamed, and found aspects relevant to today’s headlines. Hannah brought the events, hardships, and characters to life with vivid imagery.

The story begins when we meet young Elsa, a shy, book-loving and awkward young girl who meets a young Italian farmer. What follows shares her life story from hardships to triumphs as the US faces turmoil.

The author did a splendid job of giving the listener background and helping us understand our protagonists’ beginnings from the daughter of a wealthy businessman to the wife of a farmer. I connected with Elsa, understood her and admired her.

We bear witness to the tragic events surrounding the Dust Bowl, which pushed the US into an economic depression and displaced many. Families starved and succumb to the harsh environment. I could hear the dust and feel the desperation of these hardworking folks.

In 1934, Elsa travels west with her young children in search of a job. I knew very little about what happened to folks who headed west to California during this time. It horrified me. The story resonates with current news stories surrounding low wages, affordable housing, discrimination and more. Again and again history repeats from sharecroppers to unfair wages and working conditions.

Most of the story is told from Elsa’s point of view, but a few chapters are told from her Loreda, her daughter. The author’s grasp of the complexities of the mother-daughter relationship was profound. I connected to both. Even when there was strife, I never doubted the love they held for each other.

Julia Whelan was the perfect narrator for this novel. She captured all aspects of these characters and through her pacing and tone brought this well-written glimpse of American history and tragedy to life.",5,-0.8222,Negative,291
359,"I started THE FOUR WINDS late one night and I should have known better. Once I started reading, I was lost in the story and didn’t realize how much time had passed. I struggled with putting the book aside (after 3:30 a.m.) and going to sleep. I came really close to picking it up again instead of sleeping but managed a few hours before I woke up and grabbed it again. The only upside was that I started reading it on a Friday night and I didn’t have to be ready for virtual kids schooling after getting no sleep.
With THE FOUR WINDS, Kristin Hannah has created a novel with all the feels. I loved Elsa and felt so much for her. She took everything thrown at her and survived, even thrived. She would do anything for her family, especially her children and the parents that became more hers than the people she was born to. The era in which this novel took place was one that I had a basic knowledge of, but Hannah took the history and made it come alive, making me realize how little I really knew. There were times I could feel and taste physical hardships the characters experienced.
When I say this novel gave me all the feels, I am not exaggerating. It was, by turns, heartbreaking, inspirational, sad, happy… I could go on, but suffice to say, Hannah’s writing left me wrung out like an emotional rag. This was a wonderful novel. If you worry that it won’t live up to the pre-publication expectations, don’t. This novel will leave its mark and won’t be easily forgotten. Even if you forget the specific words, you won’t soon forget how you feel during and after reading THE FOUR WINDS.
Thank you to the publisher for an advanced reader’s copy of this novel. All opinions are my own and freely given.

360,"Wow! I am blown away (no pun intended). This book will stay with you long after you read the last page, much like The Nightingale. As we enter a new year with the same pandemic and political strife, so much of this book will open your eyes to the plight of those less fortunate trying to feed their families and make a living in dire times and trying to right wrongs. Sound familiar? This book takes us from Texas to California during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. I admit, I put off reading this book due to the subject matter. But, I became immersed in Elsa’s story from the beginning.

Elsa, born to wealthy parents, becomes ill as a child and thus, becomes her lot in life; frail, unattractive spinster. Elsa is ignored with only books to fill her days. She meets an attractive stranger and her life is forever changed. The Martinelli family becomes the family she always wanted. Elsa will do anything for her family to survive, even head west with Her children, to find work. Her journey is that of the migrant worker doing anything to feed their family. Friendships are formed even in this time of darkness, and love survives. Elsa’s love, devotion, determination, and strength will be visible to all, except Elsa herself.

This book is written beautifully, the characters are wonderful, giving us total insight to their plight and despair, while making them relatable with normal every day issues. Let me honest, this is not a light read. It’s dark, sad, and, at times, it will rip your heart out! But, it’s an important story that I’m sure many do not know all that well, and is all too relevant. Warning....ugly cry ahead!

361,"This book is about people, their relationships and it’s about love. - Julia Whelan
Julia Whelan is hands down one of my favorite narrators and she made this audiobook such a joy for me. Thank you for always delivering such beautiful work.
I highly recommend this book if you love realistic fiction and are brave enough to see clearly into the past and it’s ugliness. I enjoy a story that builds great, moving relationships. I loved Rose and Elsa’s relationship, it was so precious. This story broke my heart over and over. The dust bowl, the Great Depression and the human condition was debilitating. I cried at 40%, laughed at at 54%, but mostly this made me sad. It was a strong 5 star until 94% and dipped down to a low 4 star. **Ugh** No no nooooo. (Still trying to pull myself together). Oh well.
I love KH writing. Her passion for telling stories, pushing and pulling at my emotions, just like The Great Alone. Very few authors do that for me. So I’m going forward with a 4.5 star because this book earned it even if I wanted a different ending.
These were just two of my favorite quotes....there were many. Just saying.

“You're wearing you're worried face. Elsa said, it's my love face.”

“I am a warrior and a warrior never gives up. A warrior fights for those weaker than herself and that sounds like motherhood to me.” ~Elsa

Lastly, I suggest that no matter how you feel about this book or the ending. You must listen to the interview afterwards. It’s a slice of chocolate cake to finish this great work!

I absolutely loved this book! I didn't know much about it when I started it, as I will read anything by Kristin Hannah, but this book is exceptional.

Elsa Martinelli is a young woman whose life has been defined by her parents; after a childhood illness, she is considered not strong, not healthy, not pretty and a lifelong spinster. A chance meeting with a young man changes her life in a most unexpected way. As she leaves her parents to become part of another family, she learns what family can and should be, and just how strong and capable she is. But after years of living on a farm, in the midst of the Great Depression when things can't get any worse, they do. The winds scour Texas as they do the Great Plains, killing crops, drying up water, and leaving people with nothing to eat and nowhere to go. Like many others Elsa heads west to start a new life, but this time with her two children.

In California, Else learns that things are not as they have been advertised. Caught up in the endless cycle of abusive employers, lack of money, hatred and discrimination by the locals, like many newcomers Elsa feels trapped. But an unexpected encounter leads her to recognize the internal strength she has always had and helps her to become the leader she has always been inside.

The Four Winds is tells story of the migrants from the Midwest in the story of Elsa. This is historical fiction at it's best: compelling, compassionate, enraging and courageous. I will definitely read this book again!",5,0.9659,Positive,282
363,"Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for the ARC.

Beware, fair reader. Kristin Hannah's latest novel will turn you into a puddled mess and then wring you out to dry. THE FOUR WINDS is utterly brutal. And if a fictional retelling of this historical period is so harsh and unrelenting, I cannot even imagine what the real thing was like.

WINDS tells the story of Elsa, an economically privileged but emotionally deprived young woman seeking love and connection. Heading for spinsterhood, she makes a choice that will drastically change the course of her life. Over time, she begins to love the land she cultivates and the family she has found, but just when she feels secure, drought comes to the Great Plains and threatens to destroy everything she holds dear.

I am a lover of historical fiction, and Kristin Hannah is one of my favorite writers in the genre. WINDS is a truly superb addition to her oeuvre. With remarkable skill, Hannah puts you down right in the middle of the action. And even more important for good historical fiction, she doesn't pull you out of the action with anachronisms.

WINDS would have been a five star read but for a few (admittedly nitpicky) things. First, the major plot turning points are all predictable. There are no surprises. Second, it took me a while to warm up to Loreda as the second narrator. I understand why Hannah chose to use her - the story focuses on motherhood quite a bit - but I didn't connect with her in the earlier half of the book. And finally, as I mentioned at the start of this review, this book was just brutal. There is very little jollity. Instead, it's just a grueling trek from one tragedy to the next. The story is compelling, compulsively readable, and needed to be told, but for the sake of my sanity, I may have waited to read it at a happier time (post-pandemic) had I not owed the publisher a review.

Fans of historical fiction will love THE FOUR WINDS. Just put on your armor first.",4,0.9942,Positive,351
364,"Thank you to Edelweiss, St. Martin's Press, & Macmillan Publishing for the opportunity to read and review this book before it's publication date! This in no way affected my review, opinions are my own.

More than anything else in both previous books and The Four Winds, I find Hannah's writing so immersive. I found myself completely entrenched in the setting, the story, and the characters. I could see Elsa and Loreda before me; I tasted the dust swirling around me; I felt the heartache and joy, the frustration and the hope.

The story itself was well researched and informative without info-dumping, the characters felt fleshed out and real, and the relationships unbelievably relatable. Hannah's female relationships have always stood out to me and they continued this trend in The Four Winds, notably the relationships between Elsa and Jean and that of Elsa and her daughter, Loreda.

(Also, if this book piques your interest on the Dust Bowl definitely check out Ken Burns' 2012 documentary, appropriately titled ""The Dust Bowl."" The interviews and archival footage added an entirely new dimension to my understanding of both this man-made natural disaster and its aftermath.)

The only criticism I have of this book is that, to me, both the ending and a certain relationship that-shall-not-be-named-to-avoid-spoilers felt a tad bit rushed. This barely affected my enjoyment of the book, but it feels worth mentioning.

Overall, The Four Winds is yet another Kristin Hannah book that I have no problem recommending to any and all.",5,0.8864,Positive,249
365,"This is Kristin Hannah's best novel yet. It was so incredible from start to finish. I immediately cared about Elsa because of how her parents and siblings were treating her, like she didn't deserve to have happiness and good things. There was almost a V.C. Andrews feel to the beginning of the novel.

Then we get to the meat and potatoes of the story (or lack thereof, given the situation). I felt for Elsa and her family with everything they were going through. I couldn't imagine living the way they had to, but Kristin painted a vivid picture throughout. The dust winds sounded horrifying! I felt like I was right there with Elsa, toiling to earn very little money. There were some really great moments full of love and redemption to outweigh the horrible moments that could easily happen even nowadays. I like that Loreda's voice and perspective were included throughout the novel, as well. She was also an amazing character and I was impressed by her bravery.

Kristin Hannah makes a strong statement with this novel and it's one I won't easily forget. It was very powerful and also sad at times. I highly recommend picking it up as soon as it hits shelves in February. You won't be able to put it down at all!

366,"I found this book to be a very well written, thought provoking story that takes place for the most part in the 1930’s. Although this is a work of fiction, there is a lot of truth in the history of the book.
This is a story about what real life farming was like in Texas during the Great Depression. Although farming in this make believe area was thriving right after the stock market crash, the story shows just what happens when there is a four year drought and an entire community is left in despair. People have to make hard decisions, stay and fight for the land or pack up and move west, to California, in search of a better life. The story centers around one woman, Elsa and what she will do for her children even when she doesn’t think she is strong enough to do it. She shared the little she had with others, even if she couldn’t afford to. Elsa proves to be resilient and much stronger than she ever gave herself credit for.
This is definitely not a light read, this is a heavy topic but important one. I think the author did an amazing job with the description of just how hard farming life was. It never was an easy life for any farmer, then or now.
I was blown away at the ending. I never saw it coming. I can’t say any more without giving anything away.
The negative thing about the book are that I wish there had been real closure regarding one of the characters (I don’t want to give anything away).

Elsa lives in enforced solitude, an outsider in her own family. Shortly after her 25th birthday, Elsa's had enough. She goes against her parents orders and visits the speakeasy in town to listen to music wearing her new red silk dress. She meets Rafe, an Italian man who actually makes her feel pretty.
Soon after, Elsa is dumped on Rafe's doorstep, shamed, disowned, and pregnant. And there, with Rafe's parents on their Texas farm, she finds her true place...a family who loves her and a place she loves to call home. But then the stock market collapses and the nation falls into a Great Depression. The farm dries to dust as the rain refuses to fall. Starving and choking on dust Elsa refuses to leave for years, until she becomes forced to by her son's failing health.
Fleeing toward the promise of jobs and prosperity in California, Elsa again realizes she'll have to fight for the survival of herself and her children against the unfair practices of the landowners.

368,"This books takes place during the Great Depression/Dust Bowl era of American History. Sadly, many of the themes in the book mirror the current state of the country--high unemployment, food and financial insecurity. The people who migrated from the Midwest to California during the early 1930s were treated as vagrants, ""others."" ""We don't want your kind here,"" one woman said to Elsa in the book as she tried to get a job cleaning house so she could feed her children. The woman paid Elsa forty cents for ten hours of hard labor.
.
Elsa is so fierce and determined..a warrior. Her love for her children drives her to find something better for them. I rooted for her through the entire story. As with one of my favorite Kristin Hannah books, The Nightingale, I found myself completely immersed in the characters and their lives. I could feel the desperation, their hunger. I could feel the fear when the dust storms came.
.
So much of The Four Winds was just incredibly sad and horribly awful for the characters.. What people had to endure during that time was much more than I could almost bear to read. But I'm so glad I did read this book and I want to thank St. Martin's Press for my copy.

You know, the book I always recommend when anyone asks me for a good book to read. The book I would take to a deserted island and read over and over and over again. But the thing about the Nightingale is that you don’t really completely fall in love with the characters until the very end. And then you want to re-read the whole thing all over again.

But this book!!!!! This book grips you from the very beginning and never lets you go. I threw my book across the room after the first chapter because I was so angry I could spit. I was already so emotionally invested in the main character that I just wanted to cry.

This book is one of the most captivating historical fiction books I’ve read about the Great Depression. It made me think about things in a way I never had before, and I want to sit around and talk about it with people for days and days and days.

It’s her best written novel from start to finish. She nailed the art of writing with this one. I loved every single moment of it. Even the scenes that made me angry. No, especially the scenes that made me angry.

371,"My thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.
The subject matter of The Four Winds is not uplifting, nor are the main characters. Kristin Hannah has researched the Dust Bowl, The Great Depression and the California labor camps extensively and has written an inclusive book describing them all in stark terms. Happiness is scarce in this book, so if you are looking for an escape from the 2020-2021 miasma of despair, go somewhere else. If you want to know more of this huge exodus from the scorched-earth Midwest to the land of milk and honey, this is a good starting point.
Elsa Martinelli was a sickly child who felt unloved and ignored by her family, who made her believe that her physical unattractiveness was the source of all her unworthiness. She grows into a woman to be reckoned with as the book progresses, and only finds real happiness at the end. That is sad. Over the course of this book, she faces banishment, abandonment, poverty and death. Only when she was able to overcome these obstacles did she see herself as the strong woman that she had become.
As Elsa’s grandfather said:
“It wasn’t the fear that mattered in life. It was the choices made when you were afraid. You were brave because of your fear, not in spite of it. ‘Yes.’”",4,0.2572,Positive,234

When we first meet Elsa, she seems a sickly, sheltered woman with no prospects of ever leaving home in the Texas panhandle.  A ""shotgun wedding"" brings Elsa and Rafe together and she leaves home to live with Rafe and his family on their farm where they have two children.

Just over a decade later, tragedy strikes through the form of severe drought and dust storms.  The farm is devastated and Elsa learns just how strong she really is.  Her journey of triumph through true loss, challenging familial relationships, and raising two children in the most difficult of circumstances is truly inspirational.  In the end, Elsa is described as a warrior and I couldn't agree more.  Her love for her children and the things she did for them was pure strength and grit.  I had such admiration for her and the way she handled everything that came her way.

When she becomes pregnant out of wedlock, they totally reject her. She moves to a wheat farm, marries Tony -the father, and lives with him and his parents. His parents come to love and appreciate her, fostering her self confidence. She learns to be a loving mother.

382,"In The Four Winds, Elsa Wolcott is a plain and incredibly tall unmarried woman of twenty-five. Her parents hoard their love for her making her think she is unlovable. It is 1921.

“By twenty-five, the die was cast. An unmarried woman was a spinster. ‘On the shelf’ they called her, shaking heads and tsking at her lost opportunities.”

When she gets a chance at romance with eighteen-year-old Italian farm boy Rafe, Elsa grabs it. When she falls pregnant, her family forces Rafe to marry her and wash their hands of Elsa. Little does Elsa know how bad things will get a decade later when Rafe’s family farm is literally swept up into The Dust Bowl.

Wow, The Four Winds is a heart-breaking tear-jerker. It is also a meditation on the mother-daughter relationship where Elsa gets to play both roles at different times of her life. Ultimately, it is an empowering story of resilience and the ability of humans to direct the course of their life even during adverse times. I can’t imagine a better time for this to be released. 5 stars and a favorite!

The plot of her latest novel, The Four Winds, brings to light the the difficulties of American farmers and migrant workers in the 1930's. it is 1921 and Elsa Wolcott is a 25 year old spinster living with her wealthy parents in a Texas Panhandle town. When Elsa succumbs to the charms of Rafe and becomes pregnant she is forced to marry Rafe and is disowned by her parents. She learns about hard work by helping on Rafe's family farm and his mother Rose becomes Elsa's mentor. Unfortunately 1930 brings the last good crop and by 1934 the farm is dried up due to The Great Depression and drought. Rafe walks out on the family, leaving Elsa with her daughter, 12 year old Loredo and 7 year old Anthony. By 1935 Elsa is convinced that abandoning the farm and driving to California is their only hope for survival. It is in Bakersfield, California that Elsa and her children battle prejudice against migrant workers and every day becomes a fight for work and food.

385,"The Four Winds is a story that spans a period of years during one of the dark times of the nation's history. I felt as if I absorbed more history about the droughts of the Great Plains than I ever did sitting in a history class. I learn best in fiction. I admired Elsa for being so strong without realizing how great that strength was. I found this to be an emotional journey as I thought about the horrific situations she found herself in and how her will to keeping going carried her on. The thing I love about reading Kristin Hannah is that no two books seem the same - she manages to capture an entirely new world with each one.

386,"This book was just grim. I understand that it was written about a desperate time in the United States, but there was little in the characters and their relationships to help offset the depressing circumstances. Perhaps it's a realistic depiction of the times and I'll give the author credit for writing about a period of time that I knew little about - but the bleakness was simply unrelenting. Even before the hard times of the era the book was set in began, the main character was painted in a sad and pathetic way.

The one positive was that it gave me renewed appreciation and gratitude for the roof over my head, the food on my table and the reminder that we are all at the mercy of nature. I nearly gave up on the book because I read for entertainment, but I got through it (admittedly hoping for a happy ending or some lightness). If you decide to read it, just know going in that while it's a well enough written book, it's dark and grim. I'd highly recommend the author's book, The Nightingale, which was also set in very difficult times, but is one of my favorite books. Several of her other books are also awesome.",2,0.984,Positive,207
387,"I’ve always been impressed by the fact that Kristin Hannah delves into different events in history and brings them to life with such vibrancy and very real, relatable characters. She’s done it with WWII, Vietnam and now the Dust Bowl. I read the Grapes of Wrath in high school, but that was the extent of my knowledge of this subject, so I was fascinated to read about it.

The story portrays a woman, Elsa, who lives with her family on the Texas panhandle in the 1930’s and must display extreme endurance and strength in order to take care of her family during this very difficult time in history. The depiction of her struggles is extremely well-written and absolutely heartbreaking at times. I felt like I really got to know and love Elsa and wanted to reach into the pages of the book to help her. What a horribly depressing time in history! And the parallels between how “okies” were treated by California residents then and how immigrants in our country are treated by some now was striking. History does indeed repeat itself.

Kristin Hannah is back with a great historical fiction book, The Four Winds. This is the story of Elsa Martinelli, a plain woman, a little too tall for her time, a little too bookish, whose family overlooked her and her possibilities. After making a decision that changes her life forever, Elsa finds love, family and home.

Then the depression hits. And Elsa’s family farm in the Texas panhandle is devastated by The Dust Bowl. Elsa packs up her truck and her two kids and heads for The Golden State, California, with hope and dreams in her head.

But California turns out differently than expected and Elsa is forced to either give up or be brave.

This book had everything I love in historical fiction: a woman who overcomes adversity, family drama, love found, and aspects of history that I knew very little about. Ms. Hannah also did an excellent job of making historical events relevant to our modern times: migrant struggles, labor struggles, natural disasters.

390,"Kirstin Hannah's ""The Four Winds"" is a big old-fashioned historical novel, and I mean that in the best sense. After a bit of a shaky start set in 1921, which introduces protagonist Elsa Wolcott (amongst some pretty one-dimensional family members), the novel finds its footing and really starts to shine in the next section, when Elsa, now-married and a mother of two, works to keep her family provided for during the Dust Bowl years in the Texas panhandle. Hannah is a master at creating vivid settings, and her depictions of the struggle to survive in a land wracked by drought and dust storms, told in alternating chapters from Elsa's perspective and that of her 13-year-old daughter Loreda, bring this historical period to visceral life. And when a series of events lead the family to reluctantly head west for what they believe are the greener pastures of California, Elsa and Loreda get swept up in Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and the fight for migrant rights, propelling ""The Four Winds"" to a thrilling (and heartbreaking) conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have been recommending it to everyone.",4,0.8932,Positive,185
391,"I am speechless over what I have just finished reading! This is Author Kristen Hannah at her finest with a captivating story that covers a wide range of emotions and family dynamics that takes place in the panhandle of Texas beginning in 1921.

Elsinor ""Elsa"" Wolcott grew up in a wealthy family with two older and much prettier sisters and her parents never let her forget it. Elsa stood 6 feet tall, was very thin and considered herself very unattractive. Elsa was sick with a fever when she was a young teen and her parents turned her into an invalid and never let her do anything. Elsa marries Raffaello ""Rafe"" Martinelli and begins life as a farmer's wife. Life on the farm is a struggle with the depression and then the dust bowl era which forces Elsa to make a decision about staying there or heading west. That is all I will say because I do not want to reveal any spoilers.

Once in a while you come across a book that changes your perspective on life! “The Four Winds” by Kristin Hannah is such a book that takes you on the journey of a girl who endures so much diversity in life and comes out stronger through each of them. Kristin Hannah is a master storyteller and the simplicity of how the book is written takes your breath away!

The story is about the Great Depression period in America around 1930, when families from Great Plains were migrating to West in search of better future! Elsa is one of them who along with her children sets on a journey to California to prevent them from Dust Bowl and poverty. This was a captivating, heart wrenching story of courage and how a mother goes to extreme for the betterment of her children and their future.

The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah

An exceptional novel chronicling the Great Depression's mass migration to California in the 1930's. Beginning in the Texas panhandle, we follow the life of Elsa Martinelli and her family. This book is heartbreaking and devastating. That events similar to what happened to Elsa and her family happened in the United States should open our eyes to current events and all of us should feel compassion for our fellow citizens.

I only wished for a happier outcome for our family. (less)",4,0.8777,Positive,101
395,"Reminiscent in many respects of The Grapes of Wrath, this is a wonderful literary depiction of the farmer and the unemployed-turned-migrant worker, who suffered more than we today can imagine amid the Dust Bowl and the California labor strikes of the 1930s. The courageous and unassailable spirit of Elsa Martinelli, along with the love she receives from her children (Loreda and Ant) and extended family (Tony and Rosa), drives this story, which details not only the hardship and tragedy that the characters had to undergo, but also the perseverance, bravery and compassion they exhibited in the bleakest of times.

Hannah’s novel is well-plotted, and she provides great depth to her characters, who definitely seem very real. She also appears to have done extensive historical research and is very successful in embodying in her story the pain, suffering and desperation that existed among people in parts of our country during this time period. For all of these things, I applaud her.

My only quibble, and it is a small one, is that it seemed just a tad too long. I think that making this novel somewhat more compact (perhaps by about 20 percent) would have made it truly stellar. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this novel very much and consider it a great read!",4,0.9926,Positive,211
396,"The Four Winds is an intriguing tale that sweeps you away to Dalhart, Texas during the 1920s – 1930s, when the country is reeling from the great depression and the townsfolk of West Texas must decide to continue to struggle to maintain their livelihoods, identities, and health through the relentless heat, devastating wind storms, and catastrophic droughts or relocate to the lushness of California where water is plentiful, the land is fertile, but survival may be just as difficult or worse.

The prose is poetic and lyrical. The main characters are strong, resilient, and hardworking. And the plot is an enthralling, emotional saga filled with life, loss, self-discovery, motherhood, familial drama, social stratification, poverty, tragedy, discrimination, inequality, heartbreak, courage, romance, and friendship.

Overall, The Four Winds is another exquisitely written, exceptionally detailed, beautiful novel by Hannah that I absolutely adored, and is undoubtedly going to be a big hit with historical fiction fans and book clubs everywhere.",5,0.4683,Positive,157
397,"The Four Winds is another strong historical fiction novel from Kristin Hannah. I was eager to read this book set during the Great Depression, specifically in Texas and California in 1934. The Dust Bowl is taking place and our protagonist, Elsa Martinelli sets off from Texas with her two children in tow hoping for a better life in California. What they find when they get there does not measure up to the lush lands and plentiful opportunities they were expecting.

Kristin Hannah's beautiful writing makes her characters come alive. I loved the character of Elsa, as well as her daughter Loreda, and the author did a great job of showing how they grew and changed over the course of the novel. The hardship they endured not only made both mother and daughter stronger, but solidified their relationship and respect for one another. From Elsa: ""A warrior never gives up. A warrior fights for those weaker than herself. It sounds like motherhood to me.""

While I found the writing and characterization very strong, I took issue with a few inconsistencies in the plot. For example, it didn't make sense to me that Elsa's birth family was so cruel to her; we are told this is due to her being ""ugly"" and suffering a childhood illness, but that didn't seem like enough to make their behavior ring true to me.

I don’t know what planet I’ve been on but this was the first time I have ever heard of the dust bowl during the 1930’s depression. I learned so much about this era and the true hardships that these poor souls endured. It’s unimaginable that people actually survived during this time period. I actually took the time to independently read more on this subject matter.

Mostly, I was overcome with the theme of a mother’s love for her children or lack there of. Elsa’s mother lacked love but Elsa’s love for her children was abundant. Jean’s love for her children. Last but not least Mrs Martinelli’s love for her son and then her unlikely and unexpected daughter in law. I enjoyed this remarkable theme throughout this story. Having said that, there is so much more to the story.

As brutal as life on the plains was at that time, it was even more brutal in California as the family moved to find work and better times.

A selfless immigrant family teaches her what it means to tend things--the land, her loved ones, and eventually herself. She grows from a timid girl, who has learned how to be invisible, to a warrior, brave enough to take on any challenge to provide a life and future for her children.

I found the growth of the mother daughter dynamic with Rose, Elsa, and Loreda especially powerful. ""Her story—which is the story of a time and land and the indomitable will of a people—is my story; two lives woven together, and like any good story, ours will begin and end and begin again.""

Eventually, Elsa becomes one with the downtrodden that society has overlooked and finds her voice in speaking out for them. Politics aside, touching scenes of kindness and sacrifice amidst suffering and loss had me tearing up. At times lyrical, at times gritty. A must-read.",5,0.9371,Positive,178

I was torn about reading this book. I love this author, and am so rarely disappointed by her stories. However, the background of the story - the time period, the struggles. etc are not my usual preference. So I went into this book with some skepticism.

Well, I was hooked from the beginning. I needed to know what happened next. This was one of those ""stay up too late because you keep saying one more chapter"" books. I loved all of the characters and the story felt so real. I wanted it to go on and on because I was so engrossed in their journey.

Hannah's The Great Alone is one of my all time favorite books so I was thrilled and nervous to hear about the Four Winds. Kristin Hannah is an autobuy author for me, but that always comes with a little bit of anxiety. Will the next book be as good as the last? I can't 100 percent say that The Four Winds was as good and met all of my expectations.

Hannah has a way of crafting stories and characters that draw you in and consume you while you're reading or listening to them. Like the Great Alone, I will talk to anyone who will listen to me about the Four Winds. I know they're historical fiction, but I feel like I learn from them too.

Elsa Martinelli lived such a hard life, but she was such a strong amazing women. She adapted so quickly to her abrupt marriage and motherhood. As hard as life is living during a global pandemic, Elsa's life during the dust bowl and then in California was down right heartbreaking. She was such an inspiration and so dedicated to making sure her children had a better life.

When Rafe disappears, when Ant, the son, is hospitalized from the dust he has inhaled, Elsa makes the only decision she can to go to California to work, to feed her children. The time in California is a struggle as the locals look down on them, the owners of the fields pay low wages, but what can they do? They need whatever little money they make to feed their family.

Woof, my heart. There was so much packed into this book, with parts I loved and parts I didn’t. Overall, I liked it and I flew through the entire 464 page book in less than 48 hours. It switched off being narrated between Elsa and her pre-teen daughter Loreda, though I’d say Elsa narrates 70% and Loreda 30%. At first I was worried that Loreda was Marah 2.0 (iykyk), but she grew on me. I really enjoyed the Dust Bowl setting during the Great Depression and learning about the western migration. It’s a piece of our country’s history I know very little about and it’s sad and important. Overall, this book was very heavy and bleak, and I was very stressed out for the characters (which maybe shouldn’t have been surprising given the setting during the Great Depression). The first 100+ pages of this book are SLOW. So slow that I was worried that this was the first KH book I didn’t like. Thankfully that wasn’t the case, but that’s a tough way to start a book. It did end up making sense to me why she started it the way she did, but I would have preferred more character development upfront. I also struggled with the end - it ended pretty abruptly and I felt a little unsatisfied. That being said, the themes of this book were powerful and tie strongly to current times and I’ve been thinking about it a lot since finishing the book. It really made me think about “otherness” and how we treat people different from ourselves - immigrants, those experiencing homelessness, etc. We’re all people and everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

Set in the era of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, we follow main character Elsa who is shunned by her family when ""boyfriend"" Rafe gets her pregnant out of wedlock. She is taken in by his family and raises her daughter and son as she gains a work ethic and works along side them on the farm. But when times get tough, she and the kids flee to California ""the land of opportunity,"" only to be demeaned by the locals and labeled as ""Oakies."" But they will not be deterred and we see Elsa grow and love her children unconditionally--all against the backdrop of these horrible times in our history.

I was excited to read a modern take on a Dust Bowl story, and Hannah's descriptions of the degradations the land and its residents faced in the 1930s are evocative, haunting, even alarming. I had to put down my reader a few times to follow historical tangents that my mind wanted to chase.

Although ultimately I think the ending was a little off-center from the goals set out early in the book, this will be a smash hit, and rightfully so. I think this is a book which might finally open some peoples' eyes to the past they've romanticized, and the unimaginable cruelty Americans have inflicted on their countrymen in times of need.

What an amazing story. What an amazing story teller. Of all the authors I read, Ms. Hannah has the greatest ability to bring me directly into the story the minute I open the book and never let my interest fade, not even a little bit.

Drop it and move on to the next because if there's one thing there is no shortage of, it's books. Everybody wants to write.

414,"Set during the Great Depression and drought of the 1930’s, this book is all about overcoming hardships. While I found the length and continuous descriptions of the battles and pains the people of the Plains endured repetitive at times, I understand this may have been the point. These people desperately needed a break - from people too weak to help them, government who didn’t care, or Mother Nature herself - and the repetitive nature of the writing made me never forget their struggle was always present.
The female lead was a person who never realized her own strength or the power of her voice, but she worked every day to care for those she loved, even if she didn’t realize she was loved in return. While a lot of us never have to feel her levels of pain and hard work, most of us have to work to find ourselves and our voice. The story of her growth and family unfolds over many years, each with a new set of struggles and a willingness to fight.
This is a well-written book, a beautifully spun tale in the same folds as the author’s other works. I recommend it as a slow, yet powerful, read.

415,"No book report from me, read the cover, it says it all. Very mixed emotions about this book,it is both sad and uplifting how people survived in the mid 30's from the Midwest to the west coast. A Cinderella story of sorts. I found it hard to believe Elsa had no connection at all with her sisters and that the parents truly treated her like a Cinderella. All their trials and tribulations were gut wrenching and hard to read. Obviously a lot of research went into the book, I just didn't like most if the characters and found the ending ,while dramatic and full circle, was less than satisfying. With that being said, it is a very good book, its just that we want feel good during these times.

I really enjoyed this book a lot, and it was very well written like all the other Kristin Hannah books. Kristin Hannah books are not for the light hearted because they are hard hitting and goes into the dark parts of the subject the book is covering. This one takes place during the great depression it starts in Texas. I have to say the characters are well developed, but they are strong hearted women that does not takes crap. I loved the characters. This book made me call my Grandmother who is the strongest women I know, and she was born in 1935. I loved books that makes me really think, and I also love when they show us how much the world as changed. I receive an ARC of this book.

417,"I love K. Hannah, and was anxiously awaiting her new novel ""The Four Winds"". Set in the 1930's during the American ""Dust Bowl"", it is a fitting tribute to the struggles of the American sprit both then and now. It centers on Elsa, a lonely and unloved Texas panhandle girl, who finds a place with an Italian family, the Martinellis as the Dust Bowl comes to Texas to claim their farm, and the choices she will make as a wife and mother and the journey she must endure. It would not be a K. Hannah book if the road was not long, hard and painful, and heart-wrenching and the reader was not crying at some point. I knew little about this actual point in history before reading this book, so afterwards, I availed myself of the internet to read more about it and what caused it and how it ended. I highly recommend this novel, and think it ranks among her best work. My thanks to Net Galley and the publisher for the ARC",5,0.8885,Positive,174
418,"I was super excited when I was approved. I savored the read, anticipating it. I began reading and it stalled. I finally finished it, but it’s not what expected. Every two years I eagerly await Hannah’s newest book. This one began with such promise. I had difficulty sticking with the story. It’s not my favorite and while I didn’t dislike it I didn’t love it either. There are many parallels with contemporary times: economic uncertainty, fear, and loss. I guess I’ve had my fill of all those things and didn’t want to read about endless loss and tragedy. Hannah does an excellent job of recreating the barrenness of the Dustbowl, people’s fear, desperation, and poverty, the choices and sacrifices they were forced to make. I think if I had read this book in a good year, any year besides 2020, I would have liked it better. Thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for the advance read.",4,-0.828,Negative,157
419,"“It wasn’t the fear that mattered in life. It was the choices made when you were afraid. You were brave because of your fear, not in spite of it.”

Kristin Hannah paints the devastation of nature in the dust bowl and the cruelty of humanity faced by the migrant community of the Great Depression with a poignant pen. While the story evokes Steinbach’s “Grapes of Wrath”, it does so through the lens of a powerful female voice.

I was overcome by the bravery of the main character, Elsa, who never really saw herself as brave. Her grandfather’s advice to “be brave” calls to her throughout the story and drives her to make intimidating changes for the future of her children. She believes she “fails” them while in reality, she “saves” them. She is a true warrior, fueled by love. The image of the warrior is, as the author describes, the very nature of motherhood.

The strong female bonds in the story are so beautifully written.... mother-daughter, friend-friend, people-people. In these bonds, the characters find their strength and ability to keep moving forward in the face of great adversity. I was especially touched by the relationship Elsa has with her mother-in-law, another warrior. Even when the characters don’t speak, there is such true love and respect between them that jumps off the page. Between that and Elsa’s relationships with her friend Jean and with her own daughter Loreda, I was always in tears.

Overall, this is a story of hope, love, courage, and the strength of human character to get through the toughest of times...it reminds us that despite our trials, we stand up, find our voices, and remain unbroken.

I believe this will be a top read of 2021, just beautiful!

420,"Kristin Hannah is one of my favorite authors because her books are always deep and the stories are moving. The Four Winds is another amazing novel!

I was drawn to poor Elsa from the beginning. She was the underdog, kicked and unloved, and she stepped outside of herself to change things for the better. She seemed to always hesitate in the majority of the book, but was definitely a fighter and a momma bear for her children. I could relate to some of the feelings of insecurity and frustration that Elsa felt with her family and life.

I learned a lot about the Dust Bowl era. I felt the descriptions of the events and circumstances really filled the story out and gave helped me to understand Elsa's decisions. My favorite genre is historical fiction where I can learn a little and enjoy a good story. The Four Winds was perfect for me!

As years pass, she is loved and cherished, until Tony, unable to deal with the Depression and Texas dust storms, abandons them. She sets out with her children to California where they are treated as pariahs, along with the other migrants who have come from the four winds. She never abandons hope, symbolized by a lucky penny she carries.

This book, however, was set in the 1930's and told of families living in Texas during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. I learned so much about how these 2 difficult times affected real people's lives. I wasn't alive during those years so had only read about them in my history classes. Maybe a few paragraphs on each. Nothing that really showed the personal crisis these people faced. The family in the story migrates to California after hearing all the promises of how wonderful life would be there with plenty of work for everyone. And tells of their struggles when those promises end up being empty ones.

Elsie becomes pregnant, and her parents disown her. Working hard, Elsie endears herself into the lives of Rafe’s parents. When the crippling sand storms force many off the land, Elsie leaves with her daughter and son and faces even more hardship.

This in and of itself was a difficult, sad and harrowing time. Now, that this is fiction based on history, why couldn’t it have a more feel good uplifting ending?! I think the narrator was excellent ( I must use audible books) and added so much to the book that I would have missed had I read it. This added a star!

426,"Four things you’ll want to do after finishing The Four Winds:

1. Drink a ginormous glass of water. Kristin Hannah has created such a vivid portrait of the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s that you can almost feel the dirt in the back of your throat. It’s hard to imagine the ground being so dry and the weather so ferocious that you could catch dust pneumonia, yet you’ll believe it after only a few pages.

2. Look up photos of the farmers and migrants of the era. You can probably close your eyes and easily picture the famous “Migrant Mother” portrait taken by Dorothea Lange in 1936, but it took me reading this book to really grasp the helplessness of her situation.

3. Hug your mom. The relationships between our heroine Elsa and the women above and below her on her family tree are touching and unexpected. The ties that bind them together are at turns solid as the ground beneath them or frail as the animals on their land.

4. Read everything Kristin Hannah has ever written. I’m one of the rare souls who didn’t adore The Nightingale, but The Four Winds has solidified her “must read” author status with me once and for all.

I’m grateful to St. Martin’s Press and Ms. Hannah for the opportunity to read and review an advanced complimentary copy.",5,0.9791,Positive,227
427,"The last book by Kristen Hannah was so depressing that I had hoped this one would be uplifting. To my sorrow, it was just as disappointing and as depressing as the last year’s book has been. Ms Hannah did a wonderful job on her description of the Dust Bowl and what California was like when the Okies and Texans arrived...but, oh, so depressing! Right now, I want a book that brings me joy, not a book that kicks me to the curb like this one. Not sure I will spend my time reading her depressing words and descriptions anymore.",1,-0.6582,Negative,99
428,"I read The Four Winds the last week of December and ABSOLUTELY loved it. While I fell in love with Kristin Hannah a decade ago with her powerful women's fiction she has mastered historical fiction over her last few books. I love that the setting of this book is during the Great Depression, I've had an interest in the Dust Bowl since I read The Grapes of Wrath in high school.

Elsa makes the challenging choice to take her children and leave her family and the land she loves to travel to California to escape the dust that is killing her son. Through the book we see her courage and sacrifice through multiple challenging situations. The themes of family, love and perseverance are paramount in this book. Definitely need some tissues as you're reading as it's heartbreaking in parts.

I can't recommend this book enough!",5,0.9814,Positive,145
429,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is an extraordinarily tense read that makes the reader feel desperately helpless and wanting.

I let out a huge sigh when this book ended. From beginning to end, this story is wrought with pain and hardship. There is very little respite for the reader and none for the characters. Hannah transports the reader to the dark eras of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl when telling this story about the farmers broken by drought and forced to move West with nothing but hope for a better life.

The protagonist, Elsa Martinelli, is unique but relatable. She is physically ordinary in every way but she loves fiercely, feels deeply and perseveres without abandon. Hannah has a unique skill for writing about the complex relationships between women and making them feel realistic and relatable. This story is not only about surviving the drought and a depression but about motherhood and the extreme lengths a mother will go to provide for her children.

This novel is stunning and beautifully written; gripping the reader and yanking them into the story as a helpless observer. You do not just read Four Winds, you feel it. Portraying the darkest moments in a person's life and relaying the fierce tragedies of abandonment, death, starvation, poverty and complete disregard for human life; the reader feels everything. At times my heart was racing or my gut wrenching as I witnessed the horrors of this time period and what these individuals experienced. By the end of this book, I was wrecked. This story is tragic.

That said, I do not want to deter readers by just expressing how purely tragic this story is. Hope and perseverance lay claim to this narrative as well. As it is with all emotions - you cannot feel one without the opposite - you cannot feel the total despair of Four Winds without also feeling the resilient hope the characters cling to.

430,"The Four Winds is a phenomenal example of how historical fiction can bring an Era to life and define what hope and progress really mean. Kristin Hannah has a special ability to capture the trials and tribulations of the historical events which challenged the best of humanity during the Great Depression in a way that is very moving. As John Steinbeck did in ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Kristin Hannah developed characters who were believable and deserved our empathy. I became vested in the main character Elsa Martinelli from the start and deeply cared about what happened to her until the very last page. The transformation of Elsa Martinelli from an obedient daughter to a true leader willing to stand up for justice and equality for her people during the toughest part of the Great Depression was remarkable. The theme of race and the true meaning of family are strongly represented in a way that reflects the reality of the times. The role of the Company Store was unveiled as a very dark force and a tool for the constant manipulation of the workers subjected to this unfair system. There are many lessons presented in this story which act as a platform to educate us all on the importance of social justice so that this type of discrimination is not repeated. This story will stay with me as a reminder of the importance of being brave, standing up for what is right, and exercising empathy for others.",5,0.9894,Positive,246
431,"I loved this book! Kristin Hannah is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, and her writing is proof that she is well-versed in what makes up the human condition.

Elsa Martinelli was a fantastic heroine! Her strength and perseverance during a time when many were giving up hope was inspiring. She begrudgingly left the land she had come to love in order to make a better life for her children, but the journey west came with its own trials and tribulations. The “land of milk and honey” was not all it was cracked up to be, and life in California brought a whole new slew of struggles. But Elsa fought and sacrificed to provide for her family, and I truly admired her for never giving up hope.

Overall, I thought this was a wonderful and often times heart-wrenching story, but I couldn’t give it any less than five stars. Highly recommend!

I don't really know much about the Dust Bowl or the Great Depression era, but I think this was a pretty good glimpse into what both events would have been like. Hannah did a fantastic job of making this story feel realistic. I thought the characters were well developed and had real personalities, hopes, and dreams. The story was kind of medium-paced but it seemed to fly by as I read at the same time. I was definitely emotionally invested in this story and the main characters.

With emotional stories come, well... emotions. There were parts of this book that were very difficult to read. However, I do feel they were necessary, at least most of them, to make the story feel as realistic as it did. I don't think anyone thinks of the Great Depression as a happy, easy time, and I'm glad this story didn't reflect that, even if it was difficult to read at times.

Now she finds herself in a family she doesn’t know with a baby on the way. And, oh yeah, it’s the beginning of the Great Depression. Life only gets harder when drought hits and she must choose between staying with the only people who have ever loved her and trying to make a better life for her children out West.

Kristin Hannah is a master of historical fiction and this latest novel does not disappoint! While reading I would find myself very thirsty because her description of the Dust Bowl era was so real. I was so invested in the characters’ lives from the very beginning.

Thank you to NetGalley for an advance readers copy in exchange for my honest opinion.",5,0.9363,Positive,148
451,"This is another excellent book by a truly remarkable artist. I must confess, I never really thought about the “dust bowl.” Of course the depression, but not the “dust bowl.” I garnered more knowledge about how really devastating that was as it was intertwined into such a fabulous story; as always well written and such an interesting read.
I read This book quite quickly and learned about the development of unions in this part of the country and the sheer greed of some. Again, as a country we looked down upon a group of people who fell on hard times. This is a great book and definitely worth the read. A captivating story!",5,0.9366,Positive,113
452,"I was given the opportunity to read an advance copy of Kristin Hannah's new book, The Four Winds. I didn't know what the book was about, but come on. It's Kristin Hannah. Her books are wonderful. By the end I was in tears.

The book takes place in the 1930s, and follows the life of a young woman from northwest Texas. Elsa, rejected by her wealthy parents, marries a farmer and moves in with his family. The storyline follows Elsa and her family and how they deal with the Great Depression and the Dustbowl.

The Four Winds is absolutely wonderful. There is much in this book that can be applied to today's society. Another winner from Kristin Hannah! #TheFourWinds#NetGalley",5,0.9515,Positive,119

Definitely recommend

I adored and loved the women who fought their way through The Dust Bowl and Great Depression. The strength and perseverance that it took was unbelievable. Their story was unimaginable with so much loss. It really makes you appreciate all that you have. I flew through it, absolutely loving it the entire way!

455,"The Four Winds is a captivating novel of heartbreak and resilience. Elsa is a strong woman whose anxiety sometimes gets in the way of making hard choices. Loreda is a firebrand whose dedication to the fight for migrant workers is admirable… and dangerous. The various settings spring vividly to life which it makes it easy to visualize the sometimes horrific living and working conditions. Kristin Hannah brings this heartfelt and realistic novel to a bit of sad yet completely uplifting conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed and HIGHLY recommend this incredible novel.

456,"This was a really hard book for me to rate. While it was a good story, it was depressing as hell, where was the hope? I get that it was a tough time in the world but at some point there had to have been some hope.

I learned a lot about the Dust Bowl and the unfortunate way the migrants were treated after their long journey to California where there should have been jobs and a bright future.

I recently read and loved The Nightingale, and of course The Great Alone was amazing, so this author remains an auto read for me, but this book left me sad in a time when we all need a little hope.",4,0.9543,Positive,119
457,"I would like to start by saying I am a big fan of Kristin Hannah. I have probably read most of her books and have loved them all. This one is no exception.

The book takes place in the 1930's in Texas, where the Dust Bowl era took place during the Great Depression. Without rain, crops died, people were starving, loosing their livelihood, and were being buried alive in dust. Many headed west to California with the promise for a better life. After Elsa Martinelli's husband left her and her 2 children they decided to do the same. However after getting there they found that what had been advertised was not exactly what was happening. They were not accepted and were taken advantage of, being given low wages and no where to live but in camps. Elsa's daughter encouraged her to fight for their rights, joining others that were striking for unfair wages and unsanitary conditions. Elsa does not survive and her children wind up back with their grandparents in Texas.

It was heartbreaking to reading about what these people had to go through to live. I do not remember ever being taught about this period in History. Seems that there are a number of periods in American History that are not discussed as they should be. There are many dark periods, present day times included. I would highly recommend this book and thank Netgalley for giving me the opportunity to read a pre-release copy.",5,0.9031,Positive,245
458,"The Four Winds tells the heartbreaking story of a Dust Bowl family and their amazing survival abilities in the face of insurmountable odds. Kristin Hannah has delivered another well-researched, readable and engrossing historical fiction novel. You will be swept into the lives of the main characters as they navigate from the dust storms of Texas to the cotton fields of California and work to overcome prejudice and entrapment in a system that benefits growers at the expense of human beings. You will be reminded that most of the progress in our country has been made on the backs of those with little power, but the human spirit triumphs!",5,0.8582,Positive,108
459,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah is a free NetGalley ebook that I read in late December.

During 1920s Texas, Elsa exists in a reclusive place in her life and family, yet is moved and inspired by the power of books. So much so that the real world cranks into focus when she gets pregnant and marries the first boy that ever loved her. From there into the 30s, it gets pretty gratuitous and in your face about historic events (i.e. the Dust Bowl and labor uprisings) and the roles & expectations within a family. It's also quite long and can sometimes go at a plodding, day-after-day pace.",3,0.9274,Positive,108

Having heard a lot about the author in the past few years, I jumped at the opportunity to receive her new work and I am glad I finally took the plunge.

The characters and the time period are very well flushed out and show the research that would have gone in the subject matter. The book and the time period make for a very heavy reading. However, this is ultimately a story about love, family and hope.

I thoroughly enjoyed the work and would be reading all her previous works in short order.",5,0.9678,Positive,110
463,"I am very late to the Kristin Hannah party - this was my first foray into her fiction, though will not be my last! Her writing style gripped me from the first chapter, and I devoured the first 75% of this book. The two main characters we well-developed and consistent, without sacrificing good establishment of secondary characters. Good bad or indifferent, there will be no avoiding comparisons to Grapes of Wrath, though there are worse comparisons to be made, and it was refreshing to see the Great Depression viewed from a woman's perspective; seemed to cover much more ground about the challenges the Dust Bowl faced, making the move West necessary for survival. The research was impressive - I'd never heard about the devastation of the dust storms that caused further insult to injury, or much detail before about the government and employer-induced challenges faced when arriving to California hoping for a new life. While set 90 years ago, the fear of ""other-ness"" and layers of hardship on certain segments of the population felt ironically current. Overall, 4.5 stars- it might have benefitted from a little tighter editing; found the back quarter of the book a little repetitive and dragged a bit. The ending, without spoiling, came as a surprise yet rung realistic, but felt a little rushed. I'll admit I've gotten away from historical fiction as a genre of interest lately, though this opened the door back up for me.",4,0.5408,Positive,241
464,"I always know I'm going to love a Kristin Hannah book, no matter the subject matter. Her newest novel is contemporary take on The Grapes of Wrath with a feminist angle. The main character, Elsa Martinelli, is strong, smart and so easy to root for. We follow Elsa and her two children from a small town in the Texas dustbowl east to California where she is forced to live in a tent city Hooverville. I loved Elsa's no nonsense attitude and refusal to take no for an answer and I learned a lot about the hardships of the era along the way. My favorite kind of historical fiction.",4,0.9622,Positive,108
465,"I was so looking forward to this book, and was so let down. I understand what an awful, difficult time the Dust Bowl and the Depression were, but wow, this was such a dark, hard book to get through!! I kept thinking, there has to be some happiness in their lives? The tragedy just went on and on, it never let up. Oh Kristen really let me down. Yes, in parts toward the end, it was a page turner. But after the first 150 pages of this book, I almost put it down for good. Just be prepared, it is tough to get through. Here's hoping her next book isn't so darn dark and depressing, because I adore this author.",2,0.9335,Positive,120
466,"The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah. An interesting read that details the hardships of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression and the plights faced by the farm workers in California and farmers in Texas during that time. Elsa is a remarkable woman and an inspiration. Heartbreaking, depressing to read but the love of family and perseverance shines throughout. Wish the story hadn't ended so abruptly, felt there was more to Loreda's and Ant's story.

From the horrors of the Dust Bowl to the crimes against the California pickers, this book plods on. I kept hoping for some positive threads but these were few and far. I’m not saying there has to sunny side but I did keep expecting some positive lessons. For me it became a cumbersome read after 200 or so pages, always expecting some positive turn.",3,0.9591,Positive,96
468,"As a US History teacher, this book was a fascinating inside look at the Great Depression/Dust Bowl. It was like a Dorothea Lange photo come to life. The story itself was dismal and heartbreaking. Sadly, there are so many parallels with our society today - the greed of major corporations sucking the souls of their laborers. This book did not have the ending I was hoping for but I’m still glad I read it. I came away with a better understanding of that time period and the reminder that sometimes a book that makes you think is better than a book that makes you smile.",4,0.9446,Positive,105
469,"Another incredible story from historical fiction queen Kristin Hannah! The Four Winds is a story of the Great Depression, The Dust Bowl era, and the American dream, but it is also a story of the resilience of women.

472,"I haven't read many books about the dust bowl (I hated The Grapes or Wrath) and was a little worried about this topic. Kristin Hannah brought made this hard topic so tangible and relatable telling it from Elsa's point of view. The book begins with Elsa's history. She leaves a unloving family for loving and loyal in laws although her husband is a dreamer. Her children are her greatest loves. She leaves Texas in hopes of finding a better life in California after the dust bowl threatens to kill them all. Little did they know so many others flocked to California for the same reason. The Californian's thought they were trash - similarly to the Mexican migrant workers that had been run out before this. It was striking to read how these poor people treated like trash. Hannah's descriptions brought so much empathy to the situation. It was wonderful watching Elsa grow from a ""sickly"" young woman the warrior she could be. This book reminds me of American Dirt in that both are stories of mothers who will do what it takes to help her children survive in horrible circumstances. I highly recommend this novel. Kristin Hannah does not disappoint.",5,0.8833,Positive,200
473,"Spoiler alert: This book presented a lot of reality and facts about the hard times farmers and migrants experienced during the depression and dust bowl of the thirties, however the story was far fetched.

Throughout most of the novel, she is all about protecting her children but in the end involves herself and her children in an inevitably dangerous protest.",2,-0.672,Negative,89

A saga that drags you through the dust and wind then plummets you into the mud and rain, all the while keeping you turning the page with hope and encouragement for Elsa.

Through the eyes of the mother, Elsa, you were able to watch the family grow together, as they fought to survive.

This was, by far, one of my favorite books by Kristin Hannah and one of my favorites that I’ve read so far this year. The character development was wonderful, and I felt like you could really connect with not only Elsa, but her daughter. Further, just reading about their struggles was tough to make it through the book because it felt like I was there with the characters. I felt like I was living through the dust storms with them, like I was trying to make ends meet with their family. It was a book that, once I started, it was tough to tear myself away from. It was a tearjerker, emotional ride that jerked my heart in so many ways. I actually ended up reading it in less than a day because I just couldn’t put it down. This book is definitely one I recommend to anyone all.",5,0.9833,Positive,230

This story will live long in me, as I’ve already been so grateful for everything I have in my life, I will be even more.

481,"This was a historical novel about one Texas farming family’s struggles during the Great Depression. Through their lens, we learn about the thousand of Americans who migrated from the Dust Bowl part of our country to other states, primarily California.

With millions of people out of work, and thousands losing their land due to drought, tornados, dust storms, extremely hot weather, farming families from Oklahoma, Texas, etc. ultimately had no ability to grow crops and feed themselves. Many moved to California looking for work during one of the darkest periods of the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl era.

When this family (a mother and her two children) fails to be able to sustain themselves on their Texas farm, they see no other course of action than to migrate to California, in search of a better life. Unfortunately they discover that their lives are even worse there. As they try to survive as migrant workers picking cotton, they find themselves living in unimaginable conditions, preyed upon by wealthy land owners, and abhorred by Californians who don’t want their taxes to go towards helping their fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times.

551,"The Four Winds: A Novel, Kristin Hannah, author; Julia Whelan, narrator
Kristin Hannah has written a remarkable novel covering the decade and a half between 1921 and 1936. These years were a time of economic, climate, and agricultural turmoil leading to tragedy in America. The war years had finally come to an end, the Roaring Twenties and the Charleston were birthed, Prohibition had begun, and with it came the rise of the speakeasy, a new kind of clandestine night life, and crime. It was a time when the rich and the poor were separated by a number of superficial cultural beliefs concerning class, education, color, religion, morality and work ethic. Elitism was alive and well. along with deeply held prejudices, that seemed to thrive more in some areas of the country than others. The Great Depression was gestating and the Great Plains began to die of thirst. Troubling times were on the horizon.
Elsinore lived in a home without love. Her sisters were married, but she was confined to the home. at age 25, considered a spinster since she was unmarried and unmarriageable because she had contracted Rheumatic Fever when she was 14 and was told she would be ill for the rest of her life. She was told she had a weakened heart. She was repeatedly told that she was unattractive and would never marry. Her confidence waned, and she was often treated like a stick of furniture. She dressed unattractively and had hair down to her waist which she braided. She was quiet and obedient, but she read books voraciously, and very much wanted to go to college. Her father forbade it. Education was not necessary for a female. The books, however, inspired her to break free from her shuttered life.
One night, she left the house defying her parents, wearing a red dress she made for herself, looking a bit like a harlot in the eyes of those who were the upper class. That night, she met Rafe Martinelli, a young man, a farm boy, about a half dozen years her junior. Both of them were lonely, and they fell into a secret relationship. Suddenly, Elsa was pregnant and totally unprepared for it. No one had ever explained the workings of the body to her. Disowned and deposited on his doorstep, her life went into a completely different direction, as did his. He was supposed to leave for college and was engaged to be married to another, now he was tied to the farm. However, they both tried to do the right thing and make the marriage work. His family eventually embraced her more fully and more lovingly than those in the cold household where she was raised.
For a while, the Martinelli farm did well. Elsa felt like she had a family that cared about her and she loved her life. She had two children to whom she was totally devoted. Then came the drought, beginning in 1931 and continuing for years. It completely devastated the Great Plains and Texas where they lived. Crops died, farmers lost their homes and land. The Martinelli’s just barely hung on. Rafe began to drink. He hated his life and was filled with despair. Tumbleweeds bounced across the land and dust storms destroyed the farms. Houses fell into disrepair or were foreclosed. Families dispersed, husbands abandoned wives, and Rafe was one of those husbands. One day, he was simply gone, leaving everyone behind. At 12 years old, Loreda mourned the loss her father and blamed her mother, but she would come to realize that he had left them all, not just her. He had left his parents, his wife and his children. He had run from his responsibility.
When Elsa’s son Anthony developed pneumonia from the dust storms, in order to save his life and help him recover, she left the farm with her children and headed west to California. Once there, she learned what true despair was, what terrible hatred and prejudice was present in the towns she entered. Okies were not welcome. Women alone were not welcome. They were looked down upon and mistreated. They were starving. They were good people who had fallen on hard times and were treated like criminals, like animals carrying disease.
When Loreda became fed up and ran away, she met a man named Jack. He was a Communist who organized unions all over the country. He wanted them to help him. The story takes a tragic turn because of this, but as it journeys to its end, Elsa learns what real love is, Loreda learns how wonderful a a mother and daughter relationship can be and gains a purpose in life, and all the Martinellis learn about true love, at last. Communism was portrayed positively, but it wasn’t the end result of their efforts or their goals, and it represented the demand for equal rights and decent pay more than a political position of government control. They hoped and searched for mutual respect.
There were some scenes that felt contrived with too much of a romantic theme, but it was the romance that opened up Elsa’s mind and spirit. Sometimes disaster following disaster seemed to stifle the ability to suspend disbelief, because it was a stretch to believe that all of the tragedies could be experienced within the microcosm of this one family. The Progressive agenda was front and center as climate, immigration and migration were major themes. Overall, the theme was the disgraceful treatment of migrants, immigrants and those down at heel, like the “Okies”, who were refused even simple human kindness by most people who thought they were “more decent”.
The author uses the title to explain that “the four winds”, from the four corners of the world, had blown Elsa and those like her from their farms and their homes, to California and other places, to lives sometimes more hardscrabble. Gleaned from the diaries of women that lived through the dust bowl and migration westward, the author has painted a vivid picture of what their lives must have been like during those tumultuous times, and she highlights their bravery and strength. In her comment, the author compares the worst economic time in America, during the three decades of this novel, to the America now suffering from the pandemic and the ensuing economic decline in America. However, we were a country that I believe had been made great again, and only went into decline because of circumstances beyond the President’s control. It is only thanks to Trump that we were able to have a vaccine for the China Virus, and we are now hopeful that we will get the sickness and death behind us, once again restoring America to greatness.
To the author’s credit, she did not politicize this book, although she did speak of liberal issues and showed her hand in agreement with them. Hannah wanted to write a book that would emphasize the plight of women and shine a light on those with the courage and fortitude to face disaster and deprivation with grace, to illuminate the bravery of these women who bore the hardships of the day-to-day life, protecting their family, feeding them and caring for them as they suffered.
Some parts of the story seem incomplete. What happened to Rafe? How did the children fare in later life considering all they had suffered? How did the Dust Bowl end? I would have liked a fuller description of what did FDR did to help the farmers restore the Plains to productivity. I would have liked Jack, the Communist, to be more fully developed, and I would have liked the emphasis to be not on Communism, but on shared respect for people everywhere. However, this book opened my eyes to a period of time I knew little about and inspired me to investigate it further. What more can anyone want from a book than such inspiration?",4,0.9974,Positive,1318
552,"Wind, dust and the Great Depression takes it toll on the spirit and body of the Martinelli family. Elsa Is dumped by her husband and she has decided for the life of her children there is only one choice- Westward! California is the way all the people around there neighboring farms have left to trek.

This book is a phenomenal venture of not only the adversity they encountered, but the overall inequality of living standards for those who uprooted themselves to find work and food for their families.

The author does such an interesting exploration of looking through the eyes of not only a woman’s perspective, but a teenage girls as well. The author makes you feel the grains of the dust whirling in the home and the flow of mud in California as it does today! The characters spring off the pages int your heart and make you want to know more about that time of our history!

553,"’If I close my eyes sometimes, I swear I can still taste the dust…

Born into a family who lived a comfortable life, if only financially, Elsa feels like an outsider inside these walls where words are spent only to diminish her, to tell her what she will never be - good enough, healthy enough, pretty enough, wanted enough. Any attempt to live a normal life is met with words of disapproval, disdain and disregard for what she wants, let alone needs – someone to show her that she has value, someone to love, and to be loved by in return.

Set in Texas, beginning in 1921, Elsa spends much of her time inside the pages of the books she has come to view as her friends. She dreams of a life outside these walls, a place that feels, to her, like a home where she is welcomed and loved. Soon she would be twenty-five, by the standards of the time, without a man, a husband, she would be considered a spinster. Too tall. Not pretty enough, too thin, too timid. Too much of the wrong things, as society dictated, and not enough of the right ones.

One night, Elsa goes out without her parent’s knowledge, looking for a night to experience life as others her age did, trying to imagine a life beyond this, a life that included love, a home, and children. A life with joy to balance out the sadness, a life with someone who loved her as she was, with all her faults. On her way to town, she meets Raffaello Martinelli, Rafe. Meeting him, her dalliance with this man will change her life forever. Soon after, she will be married and living on a farm, and working in the fields, cooking and learning much and finding a sense of freedom and love from her new family.

The Depression captured the attention and changed the life of everyone, and now drought is changing these small cities and towns dependent on farms, and farming. Farmers are losing the battle as the ground dries up and swirls away covering floors, cars, tables, windows – anything and everything in it’s path, crops are failing, and people are packing up what they can take with them, while others are holding on to the dreams that brought them to this land which is disappearing with the winds. In time, Rafe will begin to plea with Elsa to leave with him, to head west, but Elsa has never known love before becoming a part of this family, and is reluctant to leave, especially knowing his parents will never head west where Rafe wants to go. They own this land; it is the only life they have known since they arrived in America after leaving Italy.

Reluctantly, after the dust ends up creating life-threatening conditions, Elsa is forced into accepting that it is time to leave Texas with her two children and heads to California. Having been fed on the stories of the land of milk and honey, and the government claims of plentiful jobs that are waiting, they arrive to a life very different from the one they left, as well as the one they expected. While they are no longer inhaling dust, dirt with every breath, life here is far from the Promised Land they had envisioned. It’s hard, heartbreaking at times, and as outsiders, all those coming in from other states are looked down upon, and treated badly and told they are unwelcome, unwanted, called ‘worthless’ and told to go back to where they came from.

Kristin Hannah began writing this novel over three years ago, before the pandemic, before the skyrocketing unemployment that would follow. And yet, this story is so relevant to our current days, the isolation, dwindling funds, people, as she says in her note at the end, frightened for their future, men in power shushing voices in order to further their own desires, wanting us to pay attention to what they say and not what they really mean or what they show by their actions. Or, as the Wizard of Oz said: ’Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.’

554,"""The four winds have blown us here, people from all across this country, to the very edge of this great land, and now, at last, we make our stand, fight for what we know to be right. We fight for our American dream, that it will be possible again.""

Elsa Martinelli and her children moved west for a better life. The Dust Bowl and Great Depression forced families to leave behind their barren, dust-laden lands that they loved despite hardships. Elsa bravely lets the winds cast their fate at a new future in pursuit of the American dream.

Kristin Hannah portrays the life of the farmer struggling to save their families. They faced deplorable conditions, minuscule wages and greedy landowners treating them like migrant workers. Despite disparity, they refused to give up, stood for what's right and demanded to be treated as American citizens.

Thank you to #NetGalley and the publisher for the early read in exchange for an honest review. The grit and determination Elsa displayed was a powerful reminder that although women are often depicted as the fairer sex, that's not a fair generalization.

Brave women fought to protect their families, worked alongside the men in grueling conditions and were heroes to their loved ones. Although this a fictional account, women like Elsa wore the pants in the family. That chapter is often overlooked in history books but Hannah's ""The Four Winds"" gives homage to those heroic women.",5,0.9638,Positive,240
555,"Kristin Hannah’s latest book is one of distress, poverty, and hard times such as the United States had not known before in The Four Winds. My parents were what we called “depression era babies” with the results of living as a child through that time lasting and evident in their choices. Luckily, they did not live in the Dust Bowl. Elsa Martinelli was not so fortunate.

The book shows the hardship that she and her family endured along with countless others. The Four Winds brings to life the pictures that exist documenting these difficult times and choices made. No longer faces in pictures but real people with painful stories. Also how Else survived and overcame the adversity that continued time after time in her life.

A sad read much of the time but one that reminds us of inner strength and perseverance that can be found when we dig in. A book that is needed for 2020-2021. May we be like Elsa Martinelli and her friends never like those who judged others so harshly.

556,"Devastating, brave, and heartbreaking!

Elsa Martinelli hasn't had an easy journey in life from the start: her parents have allowed her to believe she is plain and easily forgettable. A brazen decision one evening leads her to her husband, who is not only Italian but Catholic, and she begins to lead a new life with him, quickly becoming pregnant with daughter Loreda, and later with son ""Ant' Anthony. As she settles into life at the family farm in Texas, however, their life and livelihood begins to be threatened on a daily basis, as dust storms ravage their homeland and droughts and dust-induced pneumonia become the norm. Elsa is determined to save her family and makes the tough choice to take the family out west to California in search of better (or any) prospects. After their arrival, Elsa discovers the residents of California have no room in their towns, schools, or hearts for the 'Okies' (and in their eyes, all migrants are Okies) and Elsa and her children band together with another family, picking cotton until their fingers bleed, and being bled dry by the greedy landowners who continue to pay less and less while expecting more. An unlikely comrade, ""Communist"" Jack catches the ear of headstrong daughter Loreda, determined to take a stand for worker's rights and to urge her reluctant mother to do the same. When the activism takes a turn for the dangerous, though, can Loreda inspire her mother to show her inner strength to fight this last fight -while there's still time?

Coming into this novel, I had been forewarned by other early reviewers that this is a difficult read in the sense that it is heavy, sad, and incredibly depressing at times: all of this is true. I was sure to read this book when I was in the right mental space to take it in and take it for what it was, and that certainly helped me get through it in one piece! Hannah herself has mentioned that she couldn't have imagined the parallels between this tale and the world we are currently living in when she first started writing The Four Winds, and the similarities are truly stunning. Unfortunately, this reminded me that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The 'Communists' are painted as evil for expecting workers to earn a fair wage for an honest day's work. However, with the current struggle to raise the minimum wage in the United States to $15/hour, clearly this work is still not done. The wealthy and powerful are still able to lord over the average American, and in particularly in times of hardship (such as a pandemic!) the common man doesn't always have the strength or the resources to adequately fight back. Put this struggle against the battle against the elements (much like our current battle with climate change) and challenging times seem nearly unsurmountable.

The flip side to this push-and-pull? Love. It is undeniably the through line of this novel. To survive these horrific conditions without losing sense of self seems nearly impossible, but Hannah develops the character of Elsa beautifully, bringing her to realize the power she possesses simply being a woman willing to use her voice in an era where woman were seen and not often heard. There are certainly shades of Hannah's Nightingale here, in that women fittingly take the lead and demonstrate their unshakable resilience. I was in desperate need of some indomitable women in my reading, and Elsa and daughter Loreda certainly fit the bill.

As far away at the past can feel, it never truly leaves us, and although The Four Winds might seem like a tragedy from a bygone era, if there's anything 2020 has taught us a global community? We need each other. We need compassion and strength, And above all else, we cannot survive without love. 4 stars",4,0.9901,Positive,646
557,This is the 2nd book this year I have read about the plight of the farmers during the Great Depression. I had no knowledge of how severe life was. It is a book about human strength and mothers love to care for their families no matter the hardship to themselves .,5,0.7028,Positive,51
558,"What an emotional read. I always bawl my eyes out reading Kristin Hannah's books and this one is no different. I didn't like the first half of this book. I found it slow and I didn't care much about Elsa. I will say you do have to go through the first half to really understand and appreciate the second half of the book. I think during this time in our lives with the pandemic you can understand and sympathize more with what happened during the Dust Bowl. It was quite sad to see how people treated each other back than when some compassion would go a long way.

559,"I enjoy learning more about the dust bowl days. I can really appreciate the incredibly hard life they lived and helps me appreciate our lives now. The first part is all about their struggles living in Texas. This book was partially a journey book about their travels from Texas to California (my favorite part). Then the really hard part, how the “okies” lived in California trying to find work and stay fed. Also has a splash of romance. This is one of the books I just could not put down and I was so sad as I was nearing the end of the story. Give it a try. I’m off to find another book from this author!!",5,0.8689,Positive,117
560,"This is a magnificent story that traces a tragic time in US history, and yet, as the author notes, events of that time are frighteningly similar to our country in the present. I won't list the many glaring similarities, but I will praise the author who wrote a novel that both moves and informs the reader. Ms. Hannah simply brings characters and their lives to life such that the reader cares about them. The Four Winds was simply a marvelous read.",5,0.9559,Positive,81
561,"This has been, hands down, my favorite Kristin Hannah book yet. I started this book with only a shallow understanding of what the Dust Bowl era was actually like for those who lived it. This story personalized an era that rarely gets more than a blurb in high school history books, and it did it in a way that left this reader wanting to learn even more.

The main character, Elsa, seems at first to just be a plain, easily pliable woman who might leave a reader feeling vaguely annoyed at her weakness. Rather quickly though, her inner strength becomes clear and as the book progresses it is such a joy to see her grow stronger, more resilient, more adaptable, truly- a warrior. The supporting background characters are all well developed and have their own important stories to tell.

I'm not going to lie. I cried. A lot! Multiple times. But this isn't just a story of bleakness, it's also a story about the powerful survival instinct we are all born with even in the worst of times, and humanity's inane ability to somehow find that glimmer of hope even when all seems hopeless.",5,0.8842,Positive,194
562,"I grew up with a Dad who lived through the dirty 30s in Saskatchewan, where there are a lot of similarities in terms of what the dust storms, etc., were like. Everything described in this book in regard to the weather matches the stories he told me. I also read the Grapes of Wrath many years ago and this book reminded me of that, in terms of illustrating the despair of the people. I found this book to be just stunning. I learned a great deal about the migrant workers in California at the time. I thought that Elsa was one of the most powerful females I've read in a book in recent memory. The author did a beautiful job of depicting how Elsa finally found her voice. Every bit of this book was believable. Every character was living and breathing and speaking in my mind's eye. I could hardly put it down and stayed up late last night because I simply had to finish it. Yes, the subject matter is filled with despair and hopelessness, however, there is a thread of hope and positivity and strength that runs through the whole thing and saves it from being a depressing read. This is a book I will likely read again and I expect I will find even more depth in each character when I do.",5,0.9348,Positive,225
563,"I stayed up late into the night because I couldn’t put this down. It was such an amazing story of perseverance in the most challenging of times. Parts of this book were difficult to read, Elsa’s life was not easy at all, but her strength as she faced heartbreak made her a character that will stay with me a long time.",5,-0.0917,Negative,61
564,"This excellent book about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression has taken me back to my grandmother's stories about the era. After one year of COVID-19, this book showed me how this period, tragic as it is, pales in comparison to what the greatest generation endured for more than a decade.",5,0.743,Positive,52
565,"OMG What a wonderful book. I couldn’t put it down. This story of what Elsa and her family went through was devastating. We as human beings in our own hell’s can learn about what strengths we all have deep down inside of us. We all need to fight this pandemic together, because we can only do it together.",5,-0.128,Negative,58
566,I finished the Nightingale a week ago (also an amazing book) and needed something else to read. I ordered this book and finished it in 5 days! It was amazing and was so hard to put down. It pulls on every heart string and is very captivating. I am looking forward to reading more novels by Kristin Hannah.,5,0.9047,Positive,58
