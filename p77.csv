0,"As soon as we found this new fire tv remote to support TV power/volume functions we pre-ordered one on Amazon. Just as usual with Amazon prime, the shipping was superfast. It arrived on the first day it became available, which was totally a surprise. Upon receiving it we tried it with the fire TV stick we bought earlier this year for our bedroom TV (I hated to keep two remotes, 1 for TV and 1 for FireTV, by our bed, and very eager to get rid of them).
I put in batteries, nothing happened. Next, we looked into the user guide for instructions on how to pair the remote, no info. Last, we googled internet and found out, you just need to press any button on the remote a few time, and the remote will pair by itself. Even the pairing is automatic I wish there is better documentation. Otherwise, it's very confusing to the user whether it's connecting or not. Anyway, the remote got paired to the FireTV stick, it seems working just like the original remote except for controlling the Power and volume, which is the main reason to have this new remote. It doesn't work with our TV, which is also we got new in this year. When pressing the Power button the TV became dark, but it didn't actually shut off the TV, it's just like in the sleep mode for pc. For the volume buttons it simply does not have single response when pressing them. Again, there is no instructions for how to use and troubleshoot, and no technical support or anything. You have no way to know if you did something wrong or it's just incompatible with our TV, even though we noticed on our Amazon profile it had already recognized and recorded our TV brand, which indicates there is some info exchanged correctly...
Overall this is just a poorly engineered product, very disappointed!",1,-0.8929,Negative,320
1,"I bought this product with all of the things thinking that need to replace the remote for my Amazon fire box. Took a little bit to configure the remote. Then when I finally got it working it stopped after about 5 minutes. No power to the remote at all. And I replace the batteries three different times and the same result. It seems like the only time that it will work is when I completely unplug and plug back in my box, and it will only work for a few minutes while I am actively using it.",1,0.0,Neutral,97
2,"I purchased the fire TV cube several months ago. It works very well controlling my AVR and TV over HDMI-CEC. That is - it doesn't use IR codes to control devices (which is very error prone) but sends signals on the HDMI cable.

The problem is that the only way to increase the volume was to yell at Alexa or use the fire TV app on your phone. My kids were mystified - I brought them a new box to watch TV and it didn't have a volume button?!? It seems like a huge miss.

In any case, this new product fixes the volume button problem. It works flawlessly with my fire TV cube after I paired the remote. As to the product manager that decided to ship the fire TV product without a volume button... wow.",5,-0.5271,Negative,137
3,Paired in few minutes and won't stay paired also the volume and mic doesn't work,1,0.0,Neutral,15
4,"The remote works perfectly for my setup - Vizio TV, Vizio soundbar, and FireTV Ultra 4K Pendant. I don't have cable nor an AV receiver, so it is about as simple as you can get. I have the soundbar plugged into the HDMI ARC so the TV itself controls the volume.

In that configuration, the mute and volume controls control the TV volume, which in turn controls the soundbar volume. If you have the same kind of setup, once you have paired the remote with the TV, you are all done. In fact, pairing with the soundbar will NOT work and will remove your ability to control the volume.

The setup directions are very sparse because it is supposed to be self-guided by software once you pair to your FireTV. However, if you make a mistake ( I did by accidentally choosing the wrong TV brand) and don't get your TV choice done, there is no way, at least no obvious way in the guided setup, to re-choose your TV. So you end up with what you think is a 'bricked' remote.

Take heart, there is help, albeit obscure. You just need to go online to Amazon's Help section, for Amazon Devices, then choose the new remote. It's at this link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G47P2QLV6DKLKA6P

In the help section you will see how you can go to the Settings of your FireTV device and choose Equipment Control which will let you manage your equipment setup. What was really frustrating is, if Amazon had just added an extra section on the fold up directions, they could have put those helpful tips right in the box. Instead, the entire back of the directions were taken up with useless disclaimers and legalese. So the remote is very slick once paired, but the directions, if you make a mistake, are not worth the paper they are printed on. I do have to say, that the online help is really excellent AND it includes a video. Why they didn't put something more helpful in the directions, something as simple as ""If you have any trouble, visit the HELP section on Amazon.com"", is beyond me.

Now, with the remote correctly paired to my TV, I have the perfect single remote to turn my TV on and off, control the volume up or down, mute, and control everything on my FireTV. I previously used a Harmony 1100 to control my whole AV stack, but since I simplified my setup, this remote makes it a single remote solution to give me control but reduce clutter. Highly recommend.",5,0.9845,Positive,426
5,"I like the ability to increase/decrease volume or mute and the new power button. But the new plastic and manufacturing is very cheap. Rough edges, gaps, molding flash. The older remotes were of much higher build quality.",3,0.34,Positive,37
6,I would return this but had already tossed the box. Paired quickly and seemed to work fine but when the new Toshiba TV shut off the remote couldn't turn it back on. Thought the voice control might turn it on only to discover that didn't work either. (Dog ate the original remote) Finally located the correct Toshiba remote and have ordered that.,1,0.631,Positive,62
7,"First, I know tech.

I struggled to get it to work the first time. I paired and unpaired 3 times over 3 days. The final time was a charm. It is worth it once it works. The TV tells the firestick what the remote should do.

Steps. 1 Pair the device.
2. The firestick updates.

The real issue is that the instructions give no indication about the remote updating. Just says pair the device and your done. Well, if it didn't update properly and the volume buttons don't work it should specifically state to try again and even show what to expect. Even a manually update would help.

I did call tech. Spoke to 3 reps. No one had a clue what I was trying to do. Interesting that Amazon could get on my tv and take control. Bizaar yet didn't help at all. Service rep was confused and hard to understand.

Overall product is great. Just need clarity on set up.

**** update. After working correctly, it failed again. Discovered 2 things. First, there is a manual update once paired correctly. Its in the settings tab. Equipment control or something like that. I setup this way a second time and it worked again.

Also, when you setup, the remote says to plug into the original usb adapter. Do this instead of the TV. The setup says that it needs the right power supply. I know the tv provides the correct power so I moved on. However, the install stalls when you shut the tv off and the stick powers off. It continues upon restart but when I tried this a few times and it stopped when i kept constant power to the stick while I shut the tv on and off.

It works.. Keep tinkering.",5,0.4255,Positive,296
8,"EIGHT MONTH UPDATE: Bad Luck had me with a ""replacement"" Fire TV Pendant (3rd Gen, etc) and out of the box the Pendant was a ""brick"" since it would not detect/operate using the Nov 2018 2nd Gen remote. Hold Home Key till thumb went numb, un-pair, factory reset, power off/take out batteries/stand on head - no dice. Re-read the part of the review that mentioned the Odd Little Update that appeared JUST AFTER the 2nd remote was hooked up in Nov 2018.. ...Yes. Did need a 1st Gen remote to get past the Fire TV's First Run Screens.. ...then an update was downloaded/installed to make the Pendant compatible with the 2nd Gen remote. Once that was done - pressing down the Home Key on the 2nd Gen remote took seconds. To Confirm This: Removed the 1st Gen remote from settings and then took the batteries out of the 1st Gen remote - it has earned it's rest! Then factory-reset the Pendant and (to be extra annoying) un-paired the 2nd Gen remote (left/back/menu). The Un-paired 2nd Gen remote was still able to be re-detected by the factory-reset Pendant at the First Run Screens. So looks like it is confirmed that a 1st Gen remote is needed INITIALLY to allow the download/installation of Some File that only becomes available when a 2nd Gen remote is detected. Suggestion: Perhaps the Fire TV Reps should possibly test/configure/refurb Pendants using the 2nd Gen remote before shipping them out to customers. That way the Pendants might have support for the 2nd Gen remotes Out Of The Box?

(useless 2018) UPDATE: Looks like Luck is with me. The fourth person I spoke with said that the issue with the activity lights and ""Battery Offline"" is normal. I also figured out for myself that an *inactive remote* ALWAYS reports itself as ""Battery Offline"", which just means that my new remote is actually OK, it just took a few tries (?) to get it to ""pair"" properly. (?) << 2019 Edit - it was that file that was installed. Hindsight is 2020! >>
Many thanks to nice (and patient) person at Amazon Fire TV Support for her help with this issue!! :) :) :) :)
Update to the Update: :( See bottom of this boring review for Extra Trivia (software updates/etc)

For those wondering how to ""program"" the new buttons on this version of the remote with TVs and Other Devices
==================================================================================
For Information's sake, while beating my head against the floor over ""Battery Offline"" issues, I was able to see how the remote ""auto-detects"" with devices like my TV to configure the new buttons such as Power On/Off, Volume, etc. After setting up the new remote, another setup screen kicked in and auto-detected my television (""we see you have a Sony TV"") and I was asked to try On/Off and then select whether or not the TV did as it was told. Similar for volume - was asked to press ""up/down"" and then select whether or not it worked. So looks like the IR setup for the new buttons is done by auto-detection of devices rather than manual programming, entering codes, copying from an existing remote, and so forth.

- You can fine-tune this under ""Settings"" by selecting the ""Equipment Control"" category.
- Under Equipment Control//Manage Equipment//Add Equipment, you can add/configure support for additional devices such as a Sound Bar, an Xbox, AV Receivers, etc.. If no ""Equipment Control"" - update Fire Software?
- Some devices may also require the use of Alexa: Etc: ""Alexa.. switch to...X"", etc..

Some Troubleshooting Tips: (which come in handy when your new remote remains inert.)
...all this stuff takes place under Settings, Controllers and Bluetooth Devices, then Amazon Fire TV Remotes...
1) To RESET the remote, hold down THREE BUTTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY: ""Back"", ""Menu"", and ""Left"" (aka: Left side of the Circle). After 5, 10, etc seconds, the remote now should be unpaired/inactive AND IT WILL NO LONGER FUNCTION. However, it will *still show* under available remotes, but will show as ""Battery Offline"". this has NOTHING to do with the status of the battery, it just means this particular remote is now inactive/not currently paired. You cannot delete a remote that is active/in-use, so resetting a remote is one way to make it possible to be removed. Or cheat by taking the batteries out and rebooting your Fire Device, etc. To use the remote again you will need to add it back/re-pair it from the Amazon Fire TV Remotes Menu or patiently via it's Home button. Or just reboot and cross your fingers..
2) To delete a remote, it must be considered inactive first. If it's already inactive (like mine likes to be) just select it and use the ""menu"" button to delete it.
3) If you are stuck with an inactive remote that you WANT to actually use.. one that for some reason did not detect/pair properly (like mine), then try rebooting your Fire device and perhaps also holding down it's Home Button. Maybe delete the troublesome remote from the list and try re-detecting it from the Amazon Fire TV Remotes Menu. Deleting/re-detecting may save your thumb, as it took a looooong time to work just holding down it's Home Button
4) If your remote/s are not paired with your Fire Device, trying holding down that remote's HOME key (for a while) to ""force detection/pairing"". Rebooting the Fire Device wouldn't hurt. Remove batteries, reboot the Fire Device, re-insert..
5) I was told that.. ..uhm.. Using multiple Fire TV Remotes with the SAME Fire TV Device is.. uhm.. Not Supported... IT WORKED (I had one in each hand, and both were going fine..), but it was suggested that I remove one of the two remotes and just have a single remote ""active"" at any one time.

Trivia: Looks like this updated version of the remote is about 1/4"" shorter than the original/previous version.

EXTRA Trivia (1):
No clue if this is Myth or Fact
You *might* need a ""software update"" for this to work correctly... who can say?
- I know (for the Pendant at least) that there was a ""Software Update"" around October 25th or so
- I also know that I *checked* for ""updates"" the *Morning* of November 14th - None Available.
- I also know that when I spoke with an Amazon rep after connecting the new remote on the *Evening* of November 14, I was told to ""check for an update"" and there was a ""New Update"" that was *not* available only a few hours before. (coincidence?)
- I could have sworn that ""Equipment Control"" did not appear till I attached the new remote, but am not 100% sure.
--> To check for Updates: Settings, My Fire TV, About, Check For Software Update (Try this at least TWICE).
--> So far as the Pendant goes, I believe the software rev is NS6255 / 1628 as of Nov 15 2018.

Extra Trivia (2): Was reading some of the other reviews and comments, and one item popped up a bit.. ..a suggestion to use the supplied AC power adapter rather than get power via the TV. I was already using AC power (Pendant) and still ended up with a Phantom Remote for a while, but never hurts to pass on info - just in case.

Extra Trivia (3): Although I think this is listed, the new remote is not compatible with 1st Gen Fire Stick Stuff.

Extra Trivia (4): It was ""suggested"" that I have only one Fire TV Remote ""paired"" at any one time, although I was also told that having multiple remotes would not result in the newer one dropping away. ???

Useless Info: Oddly enough, my regular remote was Rev 137 but the new/upgraded remote was 124. ???

Semi-Disclaimer: I ended up with this remote as it would seem that my original remote is going through batteries at an accelerated rate and I was allowed to get this one as a replacement and only pay the various shipping charges there and back. When this recent one began displaying ""Battery Offline"" and not detecting properly - Fun Times For Me.",4,-0.9458,Negative,1351
9,"Well, they really dropped the ball on this one. How on earth can a trillion dollar company not make a remote with a few universal buttons to control a TV and sound bar? Then they come out with this mess? Someone is losing their job over this one.

Anyway, this is remote is going to work for you or not. There's no way for you to tell before you buy it. What will happen is that once you pair the remote with your Fire TV it should put up with a ""Hey, do you want to set up your TV?"" prompt. If it doesn't, send it back. It looks like it controls stuff over HDMI and not IR. So if you have any sort of video switcher between your Fire TV you are out of luck. Why not just add an IR LED to this thing? Who knows.",1,-0.35,Negative,148
10,"I am very pleased with this new remote. Having recently cut the cord and just having Fire TV on our 2 TVs it is great to have one remote for the bedroom TV that turns the TV on-and-off, adjusts the volume and operates the Fire TV stick. This new remote uses a signaling method that sends the remote commands from the Fire TV down the HDMI cable to the TV set. For everything to work you'll need a 2nd generation Fire TV or newer, and a TV that has ""HDMI-CEC"" capability. That means the TV can handle the commands sent to it over the HDMI cable. Most newer TVs have this feature, even my budget-buy 4 year old Insignia TV from Best Buy has it and it works with this remote.
To help you determine if your Fire TV device works, search you orders to find your order to determine which Fire TV device you have, then go to Fire TV Support and check the generation. If it's 2nd generation or newer you've got half of the puzzle solved.
Also check your TV's manual to see if you have an HDMI input that works with HDMI-CEC. Unfortunately, most sets only have one input that does so you may have to swap your Fire TV to that HDMI input. And, many TV manufacture has a different name for HDMI-CEC and it's capabilities are often turned off by default. Check out this article https://www.guidingtech.com/53974/hdmi-cec-tv-support/ to find out what your TV set manufacture calls the feature and a generic description of how to enable it. For my Insignia TV it is called INLink. My LG TV in my family room calls it SIMPLINK.
If your TV has the HDMI-CEC feature and your Fire TV is 2nd generation or newer, you have the second half of the puzzle solved. Order up! You can have reasonable confidence HDMI-CEC technology will work for you. (Reasonable... not perfect. This is techie stuff after all.)
Finally, when your new remote arrives, the instruction booklet will get you started pairing the new remote with your Fire TV and then an onscreen tutorial will walk you through testing each of the HDMI-CEC features.
Enjoy!",5,0.1727,Positive,364
11,Okay layout is decent dislike the feel of the remote he comes across as very cheap both in texture on the remote being a super smooth no grips the battery casing does not sit in its housing well it's continually giving this cheap feel of movement I like the ability to have the volume up and down in the mute button and the power for your TV and AV receiver other equipment is nice but everything on the remote itself feels to be of cheap grade plastic would have preferred to see it as an aluminum remote. I know remotes are made in plastics and have been for years like from the 80's . But making it have a heavier weight that makes it feel strong would be nice. Amazon older remote with Alexa felt more robust and not as cheap. The Samsung remote that i have pictured is a great look and feel,2,0.9817,Positive,154
12,"OK, I spent 15 minutes trying to get the cover off this remote to insert the batteries. It is slick and you cannot grip it. There is NOTHING in the directions or on the web to show how the compartment door opens. There are no markings on the compartment door. I compared it to my original controller and surmised it could not go in the same direction because you can see where it meets the body. I surmised the door has to be slid down . Try as I may I could not get the battery compartment door to open, frustrated I finally got it to move slightly by forcing a sharp knife blade into the crack. Finally it moved enough to slide off. I inserted the batteries, set my fire TV to Fire remote pairing, held the home button. NOTHING. Checked batteries, OK, Tried new batteries, NOTHING. THis is a major disappointment Amazon-come pick it up.",1,-0.8932,Negative,157
13,"What a disappointment. The new remote paired seamlessly with my second generation Fire TV stick. It controlled power and volume on my Panasonic plasma set on the first try, and added switching control on a later try. It also recognized my Comcast X-1 cable box immediately, and I am fairly confident I will be able to use the voice command to change channels if I can ever solve the problem that inspires this review.

I spell out all the things that work because they lead me to conclude that I do NOT have a defective device.

So much for the good news. The bad news is that the remote simply refuses to recognize my Emotiva UMC-200 device that I use to control switching between devices and to control volume to my 7.1 speaker setup. Amazon includes Emotiva on its long list of products that will work with their remote and Amazon does not list any limits on how it works. Amazon troubleshooting pages appear to be limited to making sure that CEC is activated.

I hope to update this review someday to a higher score. For now, this remote does no more than the first generation Alexa voice remote that came with the Fire stick.

UPDATE - Rating increased from two to five stars. Within a few hours of posting my initial review I received an email from Amazon asking me to schedule a time for them to call and help with my problems. They asked for 48 hours and called about 50 hours from the time I wrote back.

Paula said she had no experience with my equipment, but she did have detailed notes from her tech department. We followed through the steps suggested. There were a few hiccups, but we got the remote synced with the Emotiva, and later with my Comcast X-1 and Roku box in fairly short order. When we hit snags, she was able to message her tech guru and get back on path fairly quickly.

I am very impressed that Amazon provided this level of customer service this quickly on a product at this price level. While I am not completely sure of this, I think they actually did an update of their programming for my particular Emotiva device.

The best trick I can pass on from this experience is to keep clicking YES, even when the answer is no. It asked me to power down my processor, then asked if it worked. I said yes when the answer was no. Then it asked me to try using the volume control, and asked if that worked. It didn't but I said it did. I then made a mistake which returned me to the home page. Power did not work, said yes, then tried volume. This time it worked! It then asked for some HDMI info and then to use my original remote to change to any other input. Pushing the fast forward button then returned me to the Fire home screen. And pushing the Power button then turned the whole system off.

The remote seems to learn more and to offer more setting options the further you get into the setup process. Go through it again and if things are working, you get still more changeable options.

The remote is not perfect. It does not have enough buttons to do everything you might want done, and an awful lot of switching gets done by voice instead. You need to be very patient waiting for some of the voice commands to take. Still, I think it is very good value for the price. Paula and her customer service team did a great job for me on this one.",5,0.9742,Positive,613
14,"If it doesn't detect your equipment the only option is to add control of a TV. I have my FireStick plugged into an A/V receiver, can't control the receiver. No way to add the receiver as equipment. No way to detect the receiver. No instructions about setting up infrared part of the remote whatsoever. Amazon help no help whatsoever. Works great on the living room TV. Does not work on my other two setups with A/V receivers.",2,0.1635,Positive,77
15,"I ordered this when I lost my original remote, which I had used for about 18 months.
I was excited that this ""improved"" version had Alexa on it, controlled the volume & turned on the tv unlike the first version.
Little did I know that it usually couldn't understand my husbands deeper voice (not so much of a problem for me), but within 6 months the volume control AND the power control for the tv failed.
7/8/2019 update: replacement remote came today. SAME ISSUE: would NOT work either volume or power tv on/off. Now techie tells me ""its not compatible with my tv"" EVEN THO THE LAST ONE WORK THE VOLUME & POWER FOR 6 WEEKS!
Save your money on this and the stick, buy a roku & run your Prime shows thru it.

I asked if they would replace it since it was less than a year old. Got $5 off, still have to pay an additional $25 for another piece of junk.
Then, the second one I have ordered failed in 6 weeks. I contacted customer service. Since there is a 90 day warranty on it, I am getting another one sent to me. This is a real disappointment.

19,I have sticks on all my tvs but I hated that I needed another remote just for volume. This gets rid of the extra remote! Set up was simple thru settings just recognize remote then go back to settings for additional controlled devices. It recognized my tv and asked what I wanted to control. Sound bar set up was easy too. Very happy with this purchase. All I need now is covers to become available so I don't keep losing them. I'm convinced the covers stop from falling into depths of couches!,5,0.775,Positive,92
20,This thing won't pair at all. Followed all the troubleshooting instructions that Amazon provided online with no luck. Returning.,1,-0.0207,Neutral,19
21,Why is this remote replacement only $10 less than purchasing a Fire TV stick which also comes with the remote? It would seem that the Fire TV stick should be more expensive than the remote itself. I have purchased multiple replacements and they all work fine but the pricing does not seem logical.,2,-0.25,Negative,53
22,"Most of my Fire TVs are the Amazon Fire TV (3rd Gen, Pendant Design) and came with the older style remote that can't power on your TV or adjust the volume. For Christmas I got one of the new Fire TV Stick 4Ks and loved the new remote, which almost made me want to upgrade my older Fire TVs for the new remote, until I found that you can just buy this and pair it to your older Fire TVs (compatible models).

The remote itself is the same size and color as the older Fire TV remotes, but had 3 additional buttons: power, volume, and mute). It runs on two AAA batteries that are included in the box.

Setting this up could not have been easier. Simply go to the Fire TV's settings and go to remotes. You will then have an option to pair a new remote, click this. Then it should detect your new remote and you simply press the select button (big round button) to pair it. It should then perform a quick software update on the remote that takes a couple of minutes.

Next it will detect the model of your TV and prompt you to power it on and off with the new remote. Then check to ensure you can adjust the volume. I did this for 2 Samsung TVs and a Toshiba and it worked perfect for all of them.

Lastly, it will ask if you want to control and other inputs, like a Roku or cable box. If you say yes, it will give you instructions based on your TV model to select the HDMI port it is connected to and name it. After setting this up you can simply tell the controller to switch to your cable box and it will change the input. However, that's where using this remote stops, as you won't be able to control these inputs, just change to them.

I would recommend after setting up your new remote, un-pairing the old remote from your Fire TV and just keeping it as a spare if needed.

PROS
- Affordable replacement remote
- Give you more functionality
- Easy to setup

CONS
- Does not work with all models of the Fire TV, so check your model and make sure it is compatible
- Does not control other inputs, just changes to them

23,"I own numerous Mission Remote add-on thingies that I have used with the fire stick for years. Please allow us to pick between ""mute"" or ""input"".

24,"Disappointed, inconvenienced and angry. I ordered this replacement remote because my original one broke after less then a year. I received it in June and it was broken in August. I can use my television remote, but it doesn't scroll nearly as fast and some of the functions aren't available. I have always loved my Fire Stick, but this might be the thing that makes me run it over with my car.

History: I bought the first Fire Stick and used it for 1.5 years until the remote stopped working. Several months later I bought the new Fire Stick (gen2) and it was great until that remote stopped working after approximately 9 months. Then I ordered this replacement remote, which I had to wait for because it was out of stock for 8 - 10 weeks. Two months later, it quit working as well. After reading all the negative comments that said the exact same thing as me, I was convinced it wasn't my fault.

If these remotes stop working this often, they either need to fix them or sell them at a lower price so it's affordable to replace them.

Now, I if want to keep using my Fire Stick, I'll need to buy another one. At $29.99, it doesn't exactly fit into my budget and I can't do it every few months. It looks like I'll be researching the other streaming devices out there to find one that isn't crap.",1,-0.6654,Negative,242

He then takes my phone number and says or rather asks if it’s OK if they call back in 15 to 30 minutes it has been two hours since I have spoken with them and it’s very frustrating because now I have to hang around my house wasting my day off for them to call me back so I can fix this problem don’t get me wrong I love the remote I love being able to turn my TV on and turn it up and down without having to change remotes but if they can’t fix this problem and stand behind their product That’s not a good way to do business that’s not a good way to do business.,1,-0.7814,Negative,323

Very glad I bought the purchase plan for the 2nd gen. It seems almost as if these are made with a designed obsolescence that kicks in right when the Amazon warrantee runs out which is not long. I believe less than 3 months.
It began to reset at strange times. Then more often. Then to a point where it was impossible to use.
I had to kinda fight for a replacement (another bummer). The replacement began malfunctioning in less than a month.
Boo to this generation firestick.
I am awaiting the arrival of the 4k (newest model)... Here's hoping it's as good as the first model.",2,0.1245,Positive,139

28,"Mouse works fine, voice stuff works, machine learning, blah blah blah. Im sure you have read the description and know what its capable of. My beef is - why doesnt this remote have a ""ping"" to it from the fire TV so that I can find the darn thing. I got my parents a fire TV stick for Christmas that came with this same remote. Within the 1 week we were there, they both received and lost the remote. Its so slim and small (normally good qualities) we couldnt find it. So i had to pay almost as much as I paid for the darn firetv stick to get them an extra remote. Yea, I know there is an app that can be used instead, but at their age, they are much more comfortable/used to using a phyiscal remote. Add a find me feature and its a 5 star remote all day.",4,-0.0129,Neutral,152
29,"Had to replace so many of these between two TVs. It always starts with the remote not working for volume or mute. YouTube full of outdated fixes. It’s always over an hour call with Amazon only for them to ship out a replacement. Then they tell me you’re only allowed so many replacements for a defective device. The latest disaster was with a fire stick remote my son bought me brand new end of September. Almost 2 months later it went on the fritz. No volume. After troubleshooting with Amazon now the remote doesn’t turn the TV off and on anymore. Amazon shows me how to use the fire stick app. That’s fine and dandy but there’s no volume control or off on on the app. What’s the point? The ability to move between channel selections is not the problem. It’s always the volume and mute

Once the replacement breaks and guaranteed it will stop working I’m going to Roku.",1,-0.5366,Negative,160
30,"I was so excited to finally have a remote that could control both my TV and my Fire TV. The new remote basically paired itself with just a couple of steps to my LG TV. Unfortunately it will not control the volume on my TV. I went through the steps on the Amazon Device Support page (which basically only tell you to go through the steps to re-pair it) and the volume still cannot be adjusted on the TV with this “all in one” remote. Still having to use the TVs original remote to adjust volume kind of defeats the purpose of this thing. I am hoping they come up with a fix for this as I see many people with the same complaint. Other than that all of the other buttons are functional, but I would probably recommend waiting until they fix the bugs on this thing before purchasing.

UPDATE: After re-pairing it, un-pairing it, restarting my fire TV, taking batteries out, and unplugging everything multiple times, I was finally able to properly pair this and get it working with my TV to control the power/volume. I’d say I spent maybe 2 hours total and it seems to be an issue with the FireTV not doing whatever update/download it needs to do to activate the device control feature and have this option appear under your settings to complete the remotes setup. Then there are a series of steps you have to go through after the device control feature is activated to complete pairing. For at least an hour I was just getting a screen that said it takes 10 minutes to pair but then when I hit next it would just tell me to use this remote to turn my TV off with no other steps. Finally after what seemed like a million restarts I ended up being prompted through several other steps and the remote paired properly. I waited another week to update my review just in case I had any other issues and I’m happy to say everything is still working. I plan on getting one for my 2 year olds TV next, hoping they are on sale for Black Friday.",4,0.9074,Positive,364
31,"Simple to set up. Product synced instantly and now control volume, ON/OFF, and most importantly...Mute. I bought one for each of my Fire TV Cubes (Bedroom TV and Living room TV) I stream Tubi TV, Pluto TV and Amazon Prime. Being able to mute through the commercials is the best quality of this remote, since they are designed to MAKE you watch the commercials. Now I sit at my computer desk or in my bed, and happily mute through my news and movie programming. FABULOUS! Now if Amazon could just add control of the Timer function (since I go to sleep to movies), it would be the perfect product. I would happily plunk down another $60 to buy two more with this capability. Cheers!",5,0.9748,Positive,124

I was told that the remote is compatible with my 4k Ultra Fire tv 3rd generation on my Lg 4k tv by a representative from Amazon so I purchased 2. When I finally received and attempt to sync them they didn't work properly. I couldn't use the volume or mute buttons at all. I then called a Amazon representative again and come to find out my remotes were not compatible at all! A true waste of my time and money. I returned them and now I have to wait for my refund.

33,"I’ve been using the Fire Cube for a while now, and despite a number of naysayers, it works seamlessly with my entertainment system. The only issue was numerous remotes (TV, speakers, Fire Cube, etc). With the addition of infrared to the Amazon remote, I was able to store ALL other remotes in a drawer. A simple solution, but honestly, it makes all the difference.

**Check the compatibility of your Fire device on the homepage of this product. It is clearly listed.**

NOTE: You DO NOT have to restore your Fire TV to factory settings (as I’ve seen suggested) — this would force you to re-download and re-organize all your apps! Simply use your current (old) remote on your Fire homepage to scroll to Settings—Controllers & Bluetooth Devices—Amazon Fire TV Remotes. Have your new remote handy and begin the pairing process. The Fire TV will update your system software to allow for your new upgraded remote.

Highly recommended purchase. As long as you’re sure to follow these simple instructions, you’ll have yourself a proper, effective universal remote!

P.S. I’ve seen several comments about a downgrade in ‘build quality’. Instead of being one flush plastic piece, there are now two panels (top and bottom). This is to ALLOW FOR THE INFRARED — the entire point of the product!! Other than that, the ‘quality’ is the same!",5,0.8448,Positive,224
34,"It's great to finally have a simple single remote solution for cord-cutters. But, the price is ridiculous. I bought a couple when they were on sale for half-price, which is what they should sell for regularly. At the standard price, they are simply a rip-off. The price is why I deducted 1 star.
I'm also a bit annoyed that they weren't originally included with the Fire TV Cube, when I bought one. But, they are now standard with the Cube at the same price as I paid without it. But, has nothing to do with this review.
The only functional negative I've noticed is that the battery door seems to fit somewhat loosely, compared to the previous voice remotes. Otherwise, it's solidly made.
A nice addition over the earlier remotes is the braille-type bump on the Home button. It's so easy to hit Home instead of Play/Pause on the Fire remotes (I wish I had a dollar for each time I've done it), and the little bump should help prevent that. It would work better if it was a little more prominent. But, it's better than nothing.",4,0.9422,Positive,187
35,"The remote functions great. No issues at all. And, as an added bonus, dogs love them! My mastiff gets extremely excited when I get a new one. She starts drooling and licking her chops as soon as I pull them out of the package. I am not sure if these are made out of some kind of meat byproduct or what, but she goes nuts for them! After the first two that were eaten, we started placing the remote up on top of our entertainment center. But that didn’t stop her remote craving. She managed to get up there and munch that one down too. For the third remote, we made a pact that none of us would ever leave the remote within her reach again. She was not happy. But thanks to our 6 year old son, he hooked her up with another tasty treat. For the fourth remote, I actually bought a holster for it and attached it to the wall, about 6 feet above the floor. That worked great for about 3 days, until our creative and determined doggo managed to figure out that if she stood on the arm of the couch and leaned against the wall, she could still snag that delicious bite of electronica. She enjoyed the holster as well. So this purchase is our fifth one now. I have it secured with a steel cable auto-retracting lanyard system, which I have bolted into the wall at 7.5 feet up the wall. It makes it super handy to use, but should hopefully be out of reach now. So, in closing, the remote works great, but please, please, stop making them out of meat or whatever delicious materials you are using. There has to be a better way. My dog completely disagrees with my plea, but these $29 snacks are really starting to break the bank!",5,0.9958,Positive,311

Followed the included instructions and my FireTv Cube recognized it, added it, and added my LG TV and Yamaha Soundbar codes. What is nice is that my FireTv Cube will still recognize my old Fire TV remote, so I can place that and my LG TV and Soundbar remotes in an end-table drawer on the chance, which is likely, I may need one for some purpose. Yes, it doesn't replace my LG TV and Yamaha Soundbar remotes completely, since they both are still needed for setup and a few other purposes. But I can turn my devices on and off now with both the new remote and voice, and do the same with the volume for my Soundbar, and using voice switch between my TV's inputs. It looks much nicer just having the one, sleek remote sitting out compared to having three. Thanks Amazon.",5,0.9072,Positive,169
39,"We've been dealing with 3 remotes in the living room for a while now. I was excited with the possibility of removing at least one of them with the new Fire remote. I had assumed I could program it to the TV or the amplifier/receiver but not to both. I have a 10 year old Yamaha Amp which none of my old universal remotes would connect to, so I figured that it wouldn't but at least I could get rid of the TV remote. Well I was wrong. The simple guide brought me step by step so that it now connects to both an off brand TV and a 10 year old Amp. Down to just one simple fire remote!
One note: it was slow to connect to the fire tv stick 4k.I went through the steps a couple of times before I figured out that I just needed to be more patient. I sat it down to re-read the instructions to see what I was doing wrong and when I looked up it had connected.",5,-0.9208,Negative,176
40,"I got my first Fire TV as a Xmas gift at the end of 2015. By 2018, less than three years later, the remote started to fail. I still have remotes manufactured in the '90s that work perfectly, and I've never seen a remote go bad like this before. I've seen individual buttons get worn out, which can be repaired relatively easily, but not the entire remote cease to function. And they generally last decades.

So I bought this remote at the start of this year to replace it. I do like the extra buttons, although I wish there was just one more (an input button). However, in just 8 months, the right side of the navigation circle is starting to stick.

This forces me to conclude that the build quality of Amazon remotes are terrible, and you have to plan for a hidden cost of purchasing new remotes every few years. This is disappointing to say the least and an unwelcome step backwards given that remote reliability hasn't been an issue as long as I've been alive. Additionally, these things chew through batteries much faster than a traditional IR remote, and much faster than my bluetooth mouse does.",1,-0.5927,Negative,199

43,"I received the Fire TV Stick 4K on launch day. I own the previous model and this is a much better experience. First off the remote is a huge improvement. The power button on the remote can turn on my tv, my receiver, fire stick, and switch the inputs automatically so the fire stick is on screen and ready to go with just one click of the power button. It's really nice. This is how it should have been all along. It gets even better though... lets say my TV is already on, and my receiver is set to a different input such as my FIOS tv box? All you do is click the home button on the remote and the remote switches the receiver to the correct hdmi input on the receiver for the fire stick! One remote to rule them all, and yes it controls volume on the receiver too! This is excellent. It's highly configurable. The setup is quite nice. You can define which inputs get picked when hitting the power and home button. You can define which device the volume buttons control. Amazon has done a great job with the Fire Stick 4K.

It's faster than previous fire sticks. No more menu lag. Things are smoother and faster overall. I've used Roku, Chromecast Ultra and Fire Stick... I like them all for different reasons. I also dislike chromecast because 5.1 audio will not work on my receiver because chromecast refuses to support Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1. Fire stick has no problem handling DD5.1. This makes my plex and netflix experience much more enjoyable. The remote is better than not having a remote (chromecast). Roku's are very nice as well. All 3 of these options are great in their own way and frankly I had thought fire stick was the least desirable but recently I've come to realize I prefer Fire stick so I pre-ordered the 4K fire stick and I could not be happier with it. Amazon needs to keep up the good work. The 4K stick is a solid product and an excellent upgrade from the previous model",5,0.9473,Positive,354

I got this one for my dad, and apparently he keeps having to turn on the lights or use the flashlight on his phone to find where the buttons are on this remote. The TV power has worked great, but sadly the volume controls are useless to us as the cheap brand of audio adapter we added to our audio output to provide volume control is not in the list of supported brands. A system like on the Apple TV where an IR receiver reads the remote and programs based on that would be a nice addition (although I understand this is difficult given the FireTV does not have an IR receiver and often sits out of direct line of sight to be able to read this during the training of the remote.

The remote that came with the TV just quit working. The error message in settings says battery offline. I've replaced the batteries three times - even purchasing brand new batteries - still no go. I decided to order a new battery from Amazon. This is a total FAIL as well. First, the slide opening for the batteries was jammed on so tight it was close to impossible to open. After strugglinefor 20 minutes to open the slide I was finally successful. I put in the Amazon batteries that came with the remote. Followed the on-screen instructions and my remote was never located by the TV.
Amazon's workaround for this is to provide a Fire TV Remote App - which I downloaded. This app does work but is incredibly frustrating to operate and the controls sensitivity requires total focus to actually navigate to the screen/option you want.
With the successes of Amazon and the wonderful Fire TV it looks like they could provide a functional remote option for their customers.

The directions are clear but try and get the battery cover off by doing what it says, is next to impossible. You need something to give you friction between you and the cover if you ever want to get if off the first time. Just the fact that there are youtube videos about it, pretty much supports what I am saying. If you do succeed in putting the batteries in, the setup is easy. I personally don't like taking into a remote but the voice recognition works pretty well. As long as there is not a lot of background noise, that is. Sometimes when you push a button on the remote, it doesn't always work the first time you press it. Weird, but true. I could definitely live without it.",3,0.9894,Positive,171

We purchased in early January and now in mid April we began having issues with the sound cutting out after 20 seconds. The next day, the remote wouldn’t work at all. We replaced the batteries twice but it still won’t work at all. Because it is unfortunately just outside (JUST!) the 90-day return window, there’s nothing that we can do.

I am really disappointed in this product.",2,-0.9217,Negative,185

65,"BATTERIES WERE DEAD! (Hear that AMAZON? You sent dead batteries with a new remote.) The rest of this review is post-battery replacement. NVIDIA's SHIELD remote is awful. I read here (in other reviews) that this remote works with SHIELD. I can confirm that, even though at first SHIELD said it could not pair (then it did). The biggest benefit for me is the PAUSE/PLAY button: the SHIELD remote makes it difficult; the AMAZON remote does what I want. (I am used to using the old-style remote with a FIRE TV, so it works like that.) The documentation for this remote assumes you are going to use it with FIRE TV. I am using it with SHIELD, and it works fine. I am using SHIELD because of FIRE TV PLEX deficiencies. First off, FIRE TV does not handle VC1 format. Secondly, it does not handle all the ""HD"" audio formats. SHIELD does, as long as you have a HDCP 2.2 AVR. (I would've been happy to use FIRE TV with PLEX except for these format problems. Plenty of older media (and some newer) work fine with FIRE TV PLEX. Just not all of it.) Finally, I only bought SHIELD for its use with PLEX. And I use an AVR, so the volume controls on this remote are useless to me. (I wish they were not there.) I tried pairing on older-generation FIRE TV remote with SHIELD, and that didn't work. I will keep this remote because it does the job. But I cannot believe AMAZON shipped dead batteries...",5,-0.9682,Negative,257

Turned volume up and down, turned TV off and on, put my TV remote in the cabinet.
I was excited to see this new remote with volume. I totally missed the fact it had power and mute buttons.
Please make sure your Fire TV device is compatible before you purchase this and write negative reviews! Also, make sure your device will operate your TV through HDMI by using voice commands. On your existing remote hold the microphone button and say ""TV off/on"", ""Volume up/down"".

Setting up the remote was easy to do through the FireTV prompts. I had previously installed the FireTV app on my smartphone to control the Cube that way, so I was able to use the app to navigate the prompts to get this new remote paired. Much better now.

Pros:
So far, battery life is great and I haven't had to change the batteries for 3+ months of moderate usage. I also really like the microphone button which can be used to activate Alexa for voice commands (much easier than shouting ""Alexa!"" across the room).

The convenience speaks for itself. But I did wait til it came down to $15, since $30 was just a little much IMO, esp when the Fire TV 4K, that also comes with this remote, is frequently marked down to only $40. But for $15-20, it's a must have if your FTV model is 3rd Gen or newer.",5,-0.7964,Negative,121

After cleaning the contact several times, it just quit working on the fire stick, but it still turned the tv on and controlled the volume, although the remote control setting indicated ""battery off line"". Needless to say, I replace the batteries but it still didn't work. I believe it's a poor quality controller chip. Also there is a design flaw...the positive contact (where the battery goes) bends inward, into the remote unit and creates a false contact. If I had to redesign the unit, I would put a spring loaded contact on the positive and negative side .

It will then play for 10 to 15 minutes; turn off the Video Stream. It is frustrating to be watching the News or a TV show when the feed fails; and one looses the seconds/minute to renew (resynch?) the feed by pushing the pause/play button.

This is a flaw that is inexcusable (based on my being an observer who holds a Master of Science in Computer Science and Manager of numerous projects developing software and hardware for Cell/Video/Voice/Data applications). When the remote does not work correctly with ones own products (Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Firestiack) it is difficult to blame another Manufacturer/Service Provider.

74,"This product is great at first. It worked our Netflix and Spotify. Fabulous, until the electronics fry themselves. Our first unit stopped after about 8 months, so that's past warranty time and we got to buy a new one ourselves. The second one lasted about a month, so Amazon replaced it for us when it broke. It took two tries because they only sent the box the first go round, and we had to wait a few more days to get the third remote. It didn't work right out of the box. Meanwhile we are paying for our Netflix and Spotify and not getting to use them except on phones, so not really what we wanted. I'm pretty tired of dealing with Amazon on the phone about this. Worse, Amazon has a weird new return label policy where you have to show up in person at a UPS store with their code on your mobile phone in order to ship returns back to Amazon. They used to send you a label to print, but no more. We don't have a UPS store around, so what a hassle this is! We even spent some time on hold, waiting for supervisor's help to get a real label, but they can't make it happen from their end either. Ick, Amazon! You can do better!

Once I received the remote, it took about a minute to pair up the remote to the Cube. Everything works as I expected it to. The volume and mute buttons control my AVR. The power button turns everything on or off. Also, thankfully the battery compartment cover is easier to remove (though still a bit of a pain).

Cons: The cost of the remote $29.99 ($30), New Fire Stick that includes the new style remote $39.99 ($40). This remote is priced at 3/4 of the price of a new Fire Stick bundle. They added a Power, Volume, and Channel controls to the remote. This is the same as any other universal remote.

I have watched about 7 different YouTube videos on troubleshooting it and unplugged and replugged it about 50 times with no success. There are 2 possible reasons, either the remote itself is broken right out of the package or the batteries they included are dead/defective.

I tried replacing the batteries with ones from other remotes in the house but from what I've been reading I might head brand new better batteries to get it to pair so I'm going to try running to the store and hoping I don't get Corona to see if that will fix it.

The only gripe I have about it is that it doesn’t work with my older Yamaha receiver, but it also doesn’t have HDMI ports so it may be time for an upgrade anyways. Minimal if any input lag after the initial boot of the remote, and the IR beam seems to have a wide range. Would certainly buy it again, just wish Amazon integrated older tech so it could be even more of a universal remote. Check out their supported devices list prior to buyingnif this is an issue for you.

80,This remote is ok but does have some flaws. The battery cover does not fit securely and has a slight gap that allows the cover to slide a small amount. The original remote that this was replacing was the same remote and it only lasted about 6 months before dying. This replacement has been good so far. I was not able to program it to my TV which is a Sharp that is about 6 years old but had no problem connecting to my Yamaha receiver of the same age. Overall this remote will be great if it lasts more than 6 months. I also feel this remote is overpriced. I recently just found out that you can control the firestick with your phone but I like the convenience of having a remote.,3,0.9429,Positive,133

If you want to connect the remote to where your volume, mute, and power buttons work is another easy setup. However, there are no instructions on how to set up the latter. I had to go on Youtube to find out the latter. You have to go to settings, equipment control and hit enter on TV, then follow the prompts. I kinda wish that they had instructions to set up your remote to enjoy all of the features. Great remote though and for the money, you pay for it the remote does come with 2 AAA batteries.",5,0.9572,Positive,121

So, for the most part, the new remote makes mostly redundant the remotes for the TV and Visio.

The other TV is simply a monitor, and can't really take advantage of the added features of the remote.

It took maybe two minutes total out of the box? All I did was unplug the TV, plug it back in, put the batteries in this new remote, aim it at the TV and voila. A window popped up asking if I wanted to pair it with my soundbar, I clicked ""yes,"" then a test window popped up allowing me to test the volume control. This was the easiest, most simple tech set-up I've ever done. And having volume buttons on the Fire remote is worth the price of the remote alone. Bravo, Amazon!",5,0.0907,Positive,151

It’s cheaper quality than the stock remote, flexing and feeling flimsy in your hand. The home button no longer turns your tv and receiver on and go home on fire cube like the stock remote would. It also doesn’t seem to work as a default remote during initial setup. We had to add the remote after the cube was setup with the stock remote. The volume control is also incredibly slow to respond. You click it fast 3-5 times and it goes about 1 tick per second or so, making major volume changes tedious (say switching from one input that needs to be considerably louder to another input that is softer)

Now that I am home more and watching more tv, It stinks to have no volume control at all. I have called several times about this issue and have yet to get a resolution to this problem. I do not think it would be fare for me to have to spend another$30 for a remote that only worked a copy of months. I have several fire tv remotes in the house and over time only had to change the battery. So what is wrong with this one. Need assistance to find a resolution.",3,-0.9608,Negative,132

As others have stated this is the remote that should have shipped with the Fire TV cube from the beginning. Now I can at least control the volume on my sound bar without having to go to a separate remote. My biggest complaint, and the reason why I knock off one star, so because the buttons aren't back-lit. I realize this is a feature that goes against the design style of Amazon Fire products, but back-lit remotes are nice in the dark, and since Amazon remotes are all black it's almost impossible to see the keys in the dark.

I have the older version of the Firestick, not the first Gen, but the one that looks like a flash drive. Initial setup was a bust, and did not incorporate the volume or power controls. I did some research and discovered that the Firestick needs to sense the Volume and Power capabilities. I reset the remote, got the proper 'equipment control' menu and tried again. It worked for like three days, then didn't work anymore. So i have given up.
Now we have an extra remote that doesn't do what it was intended for.

The volume is also great its pretty much the second issue with always trying to find the TV's remote. It also awesome to have multiple remotes paired no more wondering where your wife left the remote before she left. You can have two.

My hope is that the Gen 3 with have an Input button and Channels button. Besides my fire stick my TV is hooked up to Over the Air TV and I wished I could make this the only remote I need to use with its light small form factor.

Now I use this one little remote to control all 3 devices. It's much more convenient and it is very simple.

It's still hard to get over how cheap it feels, in my hand. The edges are a little more rough and I can make it squeak/creak by ""rolling"" it in my hand. The previous version is much tighter and feels like one solid piece.

It was so easy. Just follow the instructions in the box to pair the remote, then on screen prompts walk you through pairing it with your tv.

-The volume controls do not actually control volume as output from the Fire TV Stick. Instead, it works like a universal remote and changes the volume of your TV/projector using an IR LED. This isn't a big deal but I would have liked knowing that before I bought it. Chromecasts and other streaming devices can actually adjust the volume of whatever the streaming device is outputting on HDMI. Apparently the Fire TV Stick still doesn't have this ability.

-The construction of this remote feels a lot cheaper than the previous generation remote that lacked volume controls. My old remote is solid and sturdy, and feels good to hold. This new one feels significantly cheaper, with lighter plastics. The battery cover is somewhat loose and will make creaking noises as you hold the remote.

2532,"I love this remote. The additions of the volume up, volume down, mute, and power buttons are fantastic. The remote is tapered inward rather than outward at the bottom, which makes it slightly shorter than the older Alexa enabled remote. I also notice that it’s quite a bit lighter, which makes it feel not quite as solid as the older remote, but this is probably due to the streamlining of components inside the remote which allows it to be lighter.

This remote also works incredibly well with the Nvidia Shield TV. It’s easily paired with the Shield in seconds by going to Settings > Add Accessory, then holding down the home button on the Fire TV remote for 5-10 seconds (to put it into pairing mode), then clicking on the name of the remote after it appears in the list of devices. Using this new Fire TV remote with my Nvidia Shield TV has solved all of the problems I had with the Shield’s native remote, including the remote’s lack of necessary function buttons and the annoying volume slider that adjusts the volume or pauses my video every time I pick up the remote. Using this new fire TV remote also adds many necessary functions to the Shield, including play/pause, fast forward, rewind, and menu. The volume controls and mute buttons on the Fire TV remote also work on the Shield, replacing that annoying volume touch bar. The power button on the Fire TV remote will even turn off your television (through CEC controls across the HDMI cable) AND put your shield to sleep in a SINGLE press of a button. I would even go so far as to say that using this Fire TV remote has saved my Shield experience - The Shield’s native remote had become so annoying I was considering ditching the entire Shield player.

In my photo: old remote LEFT, new remote RIGHT.",5,-0.9696,Negative,317
2533,"So some 1 star reports might be accurate due to defective devices and this is expected. But I can tell you it works and works well. I purchased two Sticks 4K (3rd gen?) which came with these remote. Got the sweet buy two special deal when it was available. I had already purchased the pendant 4K with the older remote - regret that now. Why is this remote $30???? That means the current stick is only worth $20 (since it's $50 with this $30 remote - sigh). Anyway...

I paired the remote with the stick - easy enough. The initial setup of Fire TV is a little confusing since it wants to set up the power and volume too, but the devices were not there - what??? Strange. Later, I found them in the devices section and properly selected the right equipment for power and volume buttons. All work. Here's the two set ups:

(A)
1. Element 4K TV (the Target $200 TV - very nice)
2. Visio sound bar (basic bar with sub via bluetooth?)

I selected the TV device (Element) and the audio device (visio) in the hardware section of the Fire TV settings. Also made sure CEC was turned on TV and FTV settings. TV audio turned down (no off setting in TV settings), and TV audio connected to Visio via fiber optic cable).

Power buttons turns on and off the TV and bar. Volume turns up/down the bar (leaves TV alone). All work just fine.

(B)
1. Hanspree TV (1080p set to PC video mode, no scaling, no audio)
2. Yamaha receiver with FTV 4K stick plugged into HDMI port (audio lipsync set to 750ms for perfect sync), HDMI out to TV, 5.1 speaker setup.

I simply selected the AV receiver as my sound device, the Hanspree as my TV (super surprised to see this TV included). Power buttons turn on the TV and receiver, changes the HDMI receiver input to my stick's port (HDMI1). Volume on receiver is turned up/down, TV volume left alone.

The one thing to note is that even with CEC, the remote uses IR to turn on the devices, so you have to have the remote pointed at the devices (Yamaha AV receiver, Visio sound bar, Hanspree TV). The only CEC device in my setup is the Element TV so that'll turn on no matter where my remote is pointed. One interesting thing I noticed, if the remote doesn't turn on my Visio sound bar, simply adjusting the volume up or down turns it on. This might be a Visio SB feature.

On the Hanspree/Yamaha setup, there is a slight delay when turning on the TV. It's probably because there is delay setting in the devices section and because the remote can only send out one IR signal at a time when turning on multiple devices. This just makes sense. Sometimes I am too quick and my TV doesn't turn on. I simply point and hit the power button again, which turns off my AV recvr, turns on my TV, and then I hit the button again which turns on the AV recvr. The TV ignores the second on/off signal since it's still in startup mode (ignoring any IR signals at that time). I just stumbled upon this ""feature"".

So I found that this remote works with some newer and older equipment using CEC and IR. The remote does what I need as it saves me from keeping three remotes next to me. It works with my configurations and I'm happy with the Fire TV device itself as well.

Why this thing costs $30 is a mystery. A replacement remote like this should cost maybe $15 at best. Amazon is price gouging customers, IMHO. An air mouse I used on an older Android TV box with four device functionality, similar to this remote cost only $18 - and it was trainable like a Logitech remote. I could even switch inputs on my AV receiver.

Anyway, this is a good remote. It works! It's too expensive!!!! (four stars due to price - five if it was $15)",4,0.9905,Positive,685
2534,"This is the remote that should have been released with the Fire Cube to begin with. Especially with all the initial bugs it had.
I only purchased this the other day when I noticed 50% off, since I purchased the Cube already. This is a bad faith practice by Amazon. Initial buyers should have been given this remote at no charge. They started selling the Cube in June, and then releasing this remote in October. I've learned my lesson not to purchase initial release.
The remote was easy enough to pair. Works as it should. Although, annoying that I'm stuck with 2 remotes still. It is not compatible with the Toshiba Fire TV. Thankfully they aren't identical remotes with me being blind.
I do have one voice view issue to report to blind customers. When pairing for the first time... Screen reader will repeat Searching like 50 times before connecting. It would be nice if it only said Searching only one, or two times... Then lets you know when its connected and ready to go. You need to go into Controllers and Remotes tab under settings. It’s also worth noting, have the original remote handy.",4,0.1531,Positive,195
2535,"Before I needed the Yamaha receiver remote, Samsung TV remote and fire TV remote. Now I can do with the Samsung remote and this Alexa remote with the volume controls.

Too bad I still have to use the Samsung remote to switch between HDMI1 and OTA TV input and flip TV channels. I am sure this can be fixed with a software update (hold back button or hamburger button to switch, left right to flip channels).

Sometimes it gets confused about the state of TV and Receiver because I accidentally turn the TV off with the Samsung remote. (TV off and Receiver on). If I use the power button on the Fire TV remote it turns the TV on and switches the receiver off. Adding the Input selection support will also resolve this because I won't need to use the Samsung remote anymore.",4,-0.6597,Negative,143
2536,"Before you place your order, you need to be aware of a few things and read the fine print in the item description. I made this mistake TWICE and I'd like to share what I learned.

1. This particular remote is for 2nd Gen devices. It doesn't work with 1st Gen devices. Be sure you know which version you have. Chances are if you are replacing an old device, it just may be an older generation.

2. If you are looking to replace a 2nd Gen remote... be aware you can often get an entirely new Fire TV stick for almost the same price, and it includes a remote. Amazon runs sales from time to time. As of this writing the remote is about $28 and the Fire TV with Remote is $29.

3. This does NOT work with TVs that have Fire built-in (Toshiba, Element, etc). You may need to look for their version of the remote that matches your specific model #.",3,0.0185,Neutral,164
2537,"Before I get started, I’d like to be upfront and say that Amazon sent me this remote for free. There were no strings attached, just a free updated remote to go with our new fire cube tv. I’ve had it now since November 2018.

This remote worked great to start off with. About a week after having it, some of the items I had programmed to it (soundbar, tv) just stopped responding to the remote. After calling Amazon, I discovered it had dropped all of its programming so I had to redo that. It worked fine again for another couple of weeks. About three days ago I turned on my tv only to have it start turning itself on and off repeatedly and I had to unplug everything to get it to stop. Through a process of elimination I discovered when I took the batteries out of this remote and went back to an old remote the problem fixed itself. Yesterday, I tested my theory and put new batteries back in this remote. I found that it has unpaired itself from the Fire Cube and as soon as I paired it back to the device my tv started turning itself on and off again without any ability to make it stop except disconnecting everything again. This remote as it is now is complete junk.

Please Amazon, I love your devices, but for the love of god can you guys make a remote that will last longer than a couple of months.",1,0.9296,Positive,251
2538,"Hello,
I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with video playback on Fire TV Stick.
From the issue you described, it is usually resolved by clearing the Appstore data on your Fire TV Stick.
If you're having trouble with a Prime Video title, you can try clearing data for the Video app:
1. Select ""Settings"" from the Fire TV menu.
2. Select ""Applications"" > ""Manage Installed Applications"" > ""Video.""
3. Select ""Force Stop,"" and then select ""Clear Data.""
4. When prompted to ""Delete App Data,"" select ""Clear Data"" again.
Once you've cleared application data, restart your Fire TV device by disconnecting the power cord and plugging it back in. You can also press and hold the ""Select"" and ""Play/Pause"" buttons on your Fire TV remote at the same time until the device restarts. Once your device restarts, try playing the video again.
If still the issue didn't fix, you may need to try a factory reset for your device. This can help solve intermittent issues.
Before you begin, keep in mind that a factory reset removes all content, apps, and data on your device. This may include some of your in-app purchases, so you may want to check with the app developer for information about their in-app policies.
Content you purchased from Amazon is saved to your account. You'll be able to access it again after the reset once you reregister your Fire TV device.
If you have parental controls settings enabled on your device, you'll need to turn them back on again after you set up your Fire TV.
To reset your device:
1. Select ""Settings"" from the Fire TV menu.
2. Select ""My Fire TV"" or ""Device & Software"" and then scroll to the bottom of the list.
3. Select ""Reset to Factory Defaults,"" and then confirm that you want to reset your device.
You can also Factory Reset your device by pressing and holding the back button and right on the navigation ring for a full 20 seconds. This prompts you to cancel the reset, to wait for the reset to happen automatically, or choose to go ahead and reset without waiting on the timer.
If this doesn't fix the issue, it would be easier to help you further over phone or chat. You can reach us by clicking the following link:

2539,"This same remote came with my Fire TV, the only difference is that my remote has extra buttons dedicated to Netflix, HBO etc. As far as it's function, it works just fine, after all, it's just a remote, not the Hadron Super Collider. And as for working with Alexa, that's a function of the TV not the remote, the remote just activates it.

For whatever reason, remotes fall on to the floor on occasion. But that only happens maybe once every two or three years. Since the rounded back on this particular remote means that there's less surface area to make contact with the table, and allows it to rock from side to side, it's more prone to falling to the floor. And it doesn't have to be on the edge of the table either, because it also slides more when you accidentally brush it when reaching for a nearby object. Most of the times this happens, the back comes off and the batteries fall out. If I lay it on the table face down, it doesn't fall at all, but I don't always remember to do that because I've never had to do that with a remote before.

I swear, this thing falls a few times a month. It's the only thing on my coffee table that consistently falls to the floor. I don't care about the cheap plastic and the weight, and I should note that in spite of the many times it has fallen for the length of time I've had it (over a year), it still works and none of the plastic has cracked. It still looks almost new as a matter of fact. If they change the shape, it'd be just fine.",1,-0.9349,Negative,287
2540,"Works fine. Eliminates the need for a second remote to control volume, power, mute, etc. Long overdue.

Pairs easily and then runs an update cycle. Everything you need to know to setup the remote with your other equipment can be found under Settings>Equipment Control. It's not plug-n-play; it does require some setup. I have it controlling a Vizio TV, Sony AVR, and it can switch inputs to Chromecast and blu-ray. I hope later updates will enable it to control the blu-ray player.

I deducted one star for the build quality. Earlier FireTV remotes were solid and felt very good in the hand. This one feels cheaper and lighter. There are sharp edges on the side. It's extremely difficult to remove the battery cover. And the buttons don't have the same nice feel.",4,0.9201,Positive,132
2541,"You're the kid wizard who was supposed to gain wisdom, plus common sense, when growing up. Well, I and other users have both, and we noticed the problems, the things the new Fire remote should be doing and isn't. Or tell it to work only on sunny days. Tough here in Pittsburgh. So, here's a wild idea: when you put it up for sale, also put up the common sense things, like compatibility for sure! And, it's really okay if you (and all tech companies) stop making only black devices with surfaces that slip out of our hands every time. That's when we discover the cheap material with which this device is made. And finally, it's hard to reach someone who really knows what's what, and doesn't work in an auditorium in the background and speaks American English, for folks like me, that is. And otherwise for other folks whose native language is not understandable to my American English only ears. Well, the other problem is that you think we can buy tons of stuff (uh, that's me) because of being handicapped, and complete returns within your deadline, I have learned that my best action is to break up with Amazon, and find companies that have some heart and let me return some of the many things I've bought and missed the return time being sick, in the hospital, and all the other fun things we disabled fool around with.

I don't understand, that with all the new features (versions, generations, etc), why do the remotes still require batteries? No other device in 2019 (that I own) requires batteries.

This is the worst remote. It eats batteries. No joke. It was not even 14 days ago before i had to replace the batteries again.

No. I do not want to use the &$%# app. I want a real remote. And no. I don't want to talk to my tv either. The device comes with a remote and it should function just as well. It does not.

AMAZON tech support. Please stop acting like this problem with the remotes is not a Known issue. IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE. Google it. YouTube it. It's not secret. Everybody knows. Fix it and stop offering to replace it with the same POS remote.

Oh yeah and the pairing sucks. No secrets there either.",1,-0.9421,Negative,174
2543,"Feels really cheap in hand. The cover fits on a bit loosely and the edges of the cover do not match well with the body of the remote. This results in ""sharp"" uncomfortable edges. I deduct one star for the build quality. I have two of these and they are both the same as far as build quality. The remote that came with the Fire TV box from a couple years is head and shoulders above these in build quality.

That being said, the remote itself works well for us using the Fire Stick 4K. Not into speaking to the remote so I can't really speak to how well the voice stuff works. When I press the power button, My Denon receiver and LG OLED TV both turn on and the Fire Stick 4K seems to wake up if it was sleeping. As long as the receiver was last turned off with the Fire Stick input still active, everything is up and running to watch Amazon Fire Stick content with jsut the push of the power button. Volume is a great addition and you can set the volume increments in the settings.

Now I need to figure out how to change receiver inputs using the remote so I don't have to use Alexa to do so. Would still rather do that with a button rather than yelling at Alexa.",4,0.19,Positive,229
2544,"Why isn’t there a speaker in these things standard so I can find them. It’s 2020. I remember back in the day with the old tube TVs thinking someone is going to make a new remote that beeps when you call it or something really soon. Here I am in 2020 and you have to add an external attachment to do that. You already have a microphone in there to listen to my commands put a tiny speaker in it. It already has radio instead of infrared connectivity. Put a speaker in it.

Seriously this is a black remote that’s pretty small. How is there not a speaker in it. We realize it’s 2020 right? I’m not adding a bulky $20 attachment to my remote that should already have this.

On a side note. If anyone sees my remote let me know.

Also, I have a real complaint. My remotes start to creak after a long time. Not the best made. I’d show you a video, but I CANT FIND MY REMOTE!",4,0.1174,Positive,172
2545,I was really eager to get this. The only button I wish it also had would be for the sleep timer. My issue is my TV is a commercial Samsung display. It uses different IR codes then the consumer version. The wizard guided me through 5 possibilities but if none of those work there are no other options to complete the setup. It can NOT learn IR from another remote which would solve almost 100% of that issue. I'm hoping they add more IR libraries if this is the only method. I'm still really hoping to use this because buying a new TV isn't an option.,1,0.8746,Positive,106

It ALWAYS freezes up during every show, buttons don’t even work long enough to enter my Disney Plus password, when you actually get it to work after trouble shooting for an hour the piece of junk freezes up and you’re lucky if any button works. Time to throw this waste of money in the trash. I don’t understand how there are any good ratings. Everyone I know that has one has tossed theirs and bought a Roku or Apple TV using the exact same internet provider so we know it’s the cheap fire stick. Amazon you really dropped the ball in this one.... or maybe it’s designed to scam people out of money. Wish I could return it but it’s too late. Smashing it with a hammer seems more entertaining then using the pos. Thanks so much amazon.",1,0.6689,Positive,168
2547,"I had this set up correctly. When I tried to set up my tv, the remote seemed to have a mind of its own and when I clicked on it more than once, the options would keep scrolling and scrolling and stop for no reason. I then had a phone call and left it alone, and when I returned back to the task the setup mode was gone and ready to go. Ok. Weird. So I added my app and tried to pick a show, and it did the scrolling thing again, I could not click on my options even to sign in, it would just click and click and then eventually choose whatever option it wanted. Is it haunted? Seemed like it. Anyway. I called customer service who deemed it a defective remote and told me that now that they have to send me a replacement, I have to wait a week for the replacement.

I really wish it had channel up and channel down buttons. If it had these and an input/source button, it would be about perfect.

With that being said, the quality of these don't seem to be the same as previous fire remotes. They feel cheap and the battery cover will not stay on. I actually had Amazon send a replacement because the battery door was so loose and the replacement is the same

After calling Amazon, I was VERY promptly send a N/C replacement but it had the same problem...could not slipe the back cover off because form outweighed function and everything is too slick. So, I McGyvered it by using a soldering iron to create horizontal marks across the back battery cover. Now, my thumb has some resistance on the used to be slick cover and it now removes easily.

So I complained and got half off. Received remote today, paired with holding the home button for 10 seconds (for those complaining here), paired right away and everything works as it should.

2561,"I have had two remotes for my Amazon Stick already and have barely had it a year. I had the original controller that came with the stick and it ate batteries like crazy, every few days I had to change them. So with some haggling the company finally agreed I was a good enough customer (which I am!) to send me the newest one with voice control etc with a credit to my account as soon as it came available and hoping it would be better I took the offer. So it came and I liked the extra features very much though the remote itself is cheaply made. Why a company as huge as Amazon can't figure that people don't want a remote with no volume and on/off controls is beyond me. This far into the science of TV that anyone has to juggle two remotes is crazy. But the second controller worked without eating up batteries... for a moment. Within a month or so it stopped working and no matter how many new batteries I fed it, no luck. I did all the reboot stuff as well. So I have been sitting on my decision for several months now just using my laptop and I-pad trying to decide if I was going to re invest in another! controller and now at my expense. My husband has several controllers for his Roku around the house and never had a single issue. Get with it Amazon. So today I'm going to give it one more try. I'm going to cough up the money and get another remote from Amazon for my Fire Stick, because I do like the system itself. I'm crossing my fingers.

2881,"First time I used one of these was when I got my Fire TV Cube version 2's (they come with one), but I also had an old version 1 that I bought this for since they don't come with a remote that can do volume and power controls. I paired this with the version 1 cube and it's just like a Fire TV Cube version 2 (I wonder if the remote is the only difference between v1 and v2, but I guess it doesn't matter since they already got my money long ago).

The Fire TV Cube also makes it easy to setup this remote for your TV (there's no codes to be entered or any of that), and I'd imagine regular Fire TV, or whatever you're using this with, would do the same. It actually worked without the full setup once I paired it to the cube, surprisingly.

These are great remotes, though, especially when you put a nice case on it (so you can find it easier and it feels nice in your hand -- not that it doesn't feel nice anyway). I hardly ever have trouble finding my remote since I bought a bright orange colored case for it, but I guess that's more the case than the remote obviously. It's easier to find cases for these since these are being mass produced, though, which is one reason why I like them.

Wish they were $25, but I think everything can be cheaper.

Note: I tried to pair this with my Echo Studio (alone, without being paired with a Fire TV Cube), and it doesn't seem to work, so make sure to check compatibility with whatever device you plan to use this with.",5,0.9799,Positive,286
2882,"I will update this review later if the remote unpairs. That seems to be one of the main negative points in other reviews.

I have a fire tv 4k, the one on a dongle. I lost my remote and used this remote as a replacement remote and I had to download the fire tv remote app on my phone to setup this remote.

Once I had the app installed pairing this remote was very easy. I was also able to setup the power button to work with both my TV and sound bar, and the volume controls to work with my soundbar. This was all done via the setup in the fire tv and was about the easiest pairing process I have ever done on a remote.",5,-0.7357,Negative,127
2883,I am so happy with my remote control. It is so nice having a remote control of my own. Now I can I have one of my own. Others in the house kept misplacing the one that came with the device. But also knowing I can order a replacement If needed is the greatest. Programing was easy as long as you look over the directions. Now we have 2 remotes and life is good in our home once more. LOL!!!,5,0.9794,Positive,80
2884,"This Amazon Remote is awesome, not only does it connect to your FireTV Stick, it connect to your actual TV. The power and volume buttons are awesome. We lost the remote to our TV and instead of buying one of those faulty universal remotes we purchased this updated FireTV remote. It connected to our devices easily and is such a convenient option. Highly recommend!",5,0.8953,Positive,64
2885,"Works great with the FIre TV cube I already have. The remote from the existing one had seen better days, so I needed new one. Shopping for it was easy. Search within AMAZON brought me right to it. Way, way easy to pair. Have your old remote ready (if it still works) easy to follow pairing instructions included.",5,0.9534,Positive,58
2886,"If you're looking to replace your Toshiba Fire TV remote, DO NOT BUY!!!

Broke the remote that came with my Toshiba Fire TV, ordered this one. None of the methods or power cycling ever paired it. Even tried using the app on my phone (which worked) to get into the TV settings and add a new remote, never paired. Tried a factory reset on the TV, and now I can no longer use my TV. DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE!!!!!",1,-0.7037,Negative,80

2892,"This remote replaces me having to use the regular TV remote to control the volume. It feels good in my hand too. I wish it glowed in the dark. Also, Sometimes I loose it and wish a call button was on the tv box so I can find it. It's a nice small sized remote that fits comfortably in my hand.",5,0.9517,Positive,61
2893,"I didn't realize that they had a remote with volume control when I stumbled upon this. With the addition of this remote and CEC HDMI control on TV turned on, the TV now shows up and works with Alexa. Without this remote we had to use a second one for volume. Not the worst thing but inconvenient (first world problems)",5,-0.6708,Negative,60
